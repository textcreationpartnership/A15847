            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd no leſse honoured Lord. I ſee many make uſe of your lines, few acknowledge, none return to give thanks: but no cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like the fellony of wit; for hee which theeves that, robs the owner, and cooſens all that heare him. Why I preſume to make uſe of your name, is not hard to divine; your intereſt being ſo juſt, and great, both in the man, and matter: it is not my reſpect onely, but your right; and for encouragement, your own words may ſerve mee for a ſufficient both plea, and protection. It is your Lordſhips, that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of love, feare not to be ill taken of
<pb facs="tcp:23461:4"/>ſtrangers,</hi> Nor could I more fitly dedicate this Book, which (ſo much croſsing the ſtream of natur all corruption) may happily provoke ſome inſolent, yea, potent offenders.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſo over eſteeme theſe lines, as to hold them worthy your judicious eyes, much leſſe your patronage: yet, as the caſe ſtandeth with mee, it would bee no leſſe then injurious, not to look ſo high; and I ſhould offend, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed not. Benefits received, are bonds obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: and if ſo, both my duty and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe make my beſt ſervices your debt, and if neither of theſe, my moſt endeared affection: VVhether ſhould the River return, if not to the Ocean, from whence it received it's ſtreams? And I have not alone watered my Garden from your Fountain; but a great part of this my Candles light, took it's being (next the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods word) from the ſhining Lamp of your Workes. Many of theſe are Flowers from your Garden, Sciences from your Orchard, I have taken a great part of my Seed from your Granary: if I ſhall ſeeme to ſaucy, in plucking and taking them, without leave from the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; I humbly crave, that reſtitution and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment may ſerve for part of amends. If this Poſie and new fruit anſwer your ſent and taſt, I have obtained my deſire: or if the
<pb facs="tcp:23461:4"/>graine of this new Crop chance to differ, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the fault to the Soyle, and Seeds-man; though it was not my purpoſe to impaire the quality, by improving the quantity.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, as the Bee gathers from one Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wax; from another, Honey; from a third, Bee-Glew, and bringeth to her Hive that which is profitable from all: ſo have I (under correction) filch't from your Lordſhips worthy Workes, and other Authors, (both divine and humane, whether Ancients or Neotericks) whatſoever elegant Phraſes, pithy Sentences, curious Metaphors, witty Apothegmes, ſweet Similitudes, or Rhetoricall expreſsions I could meet withal, pertinent, wholeſome, and delect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, wherewith to enamell this Treatiſe of mine: ſo that you may almoſt ſay of it, as <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>llodorus</hi> was wont to ſay of <hi>Chryſippus</hi> his Bookes, <hi>That if other mens ſentences were left out, the Pages would be void:</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cannot but reſemble it to <hi>Horace</hi> his Daw, which was dreſt and pranked in other Birds feathers, being otherwiſe naked and bare: nay, my ſelfe will acknowledge, that to this Noſegay of ſtrange Flowers, I have put little of mine owne, but the Thread to bind them; and that to all this Frame, I have not much more then made the Pins, which faſten
<pb facs="tcp:23461:5"/>the joynts together; for moſt of the materials were ſquared and faſhioned to my hand, by more judicious workmen: it is but borrowed Mettal, caſt into a new mould. Yet pardon me, he who hath but a Cock-boat to ſayle in, muſt not go far from the ſhore: and ſuch as want a ſtock of their own, are forced to borrow, and trade with other mens money. Peradventure the Magazine of my memory is better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with matter, then the Store-houſe of my invention; yet each are ſo meanly, as I am forced both to pity and diſdaine my felfe.</p>
                  <p>Who knoweth not, that the ſuggeſtion of one new thought, is harder, and better, then many repeated? wherein your Lordſhip excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſome other of my Authors, as the Sunne in brightneſſe the reſt of the Planets. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that in three hundred Volumes, which he left behind him, he had not made uſe of one Allegation: who, in our times, doth reſemble him more then your Lordſhip, leſſe then my ſelfe? yet this I will avouch in mine owne praiſe, that I love wiſdome, and honour learning, as much as they that have them. And for my defence, if in reaſons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, and arguments, I tranſplant any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Soyle: I am no thiefe in it: ſince I either ſay, or am ready to acknowledge of whom I had
<pb facs="tcp:23461:5"/>them. I have ſo made uſe of other mens wits, as you may ſee I doe not ſteale, but borrow. I deſire not to conceale their names, as naughty women do the right fathers of their children; though I confeſſe, many of my Authors names, and places, of what I have hudled up together, are by me ſo abſolutely forgotten; that he which would know of me whence they are taken, and from whom I had them, would greatly put me to my ſhifts: yet have I not beg'd them but at honourable and well known gates; they are all, or almoſt all, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that, me thinks, they ſufficiently name themſelves, without me; for they are both rich, and they alſo come from rich and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy hands; wherein Authority doth concurre with reaſon. But of all the reſt, it is eaſie for any, that have been converſant in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Bookes, to know by the ſmell of each Flower, which hath had the aſpect of your Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Neither (if I ſhall ſpeak ingenuouſly) had this Web ever beene, but for the Silke, which I found ready ſpun from your worthy breaſts. I had ſuff red ſh pwrack on the firſt ſhore, but that I was ſteered by ſo good a Pilot, as your ſelfe, by whoſe Compaſſe I have ſecurely ſailed, and (though ſometimes weather-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)

                     <p>It is true indeed, that the world now waxing old, and, as it were, hoarehea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, cannot generate children of ſuch ſtrength and vigour as it did in time of youth and full ſtrength; and therefore wee muſt needs decline, as the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth: it is true alſo, that the mother earth is infeebled with much bearing, and hath her ſtrength much abated with ſo innumerable childbirths, and being now come to her cold melancholy age, cannot bring forth her fruits ſo full of vertue and ſtrength, and ſo fit for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of our bodies, as ſhee did in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: but that there ſhould be ſuch a change, ſo ſuddaine and extraordinary, in the great difference of our health, ſtrength, and long life, betwixt this our age, and that which went next before it;

                     <p>Indeed, drunkards pretend they drinke healthes, and for health.

                     <p>That many have periſhed by this meanes we read, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 37.30.31. &amp; if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then, ſurely many millions now: for in former ages it was as rare, as now it is common.

And laſtly, wee reade that they would never drinke wine before they were twenty yeares of age; whereas many of our children are halfe killed, before they are borne, with diſtempered drinkes: at leaſt, when they are borne, no day, no meale, muſt they be without ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping downe wine, their over indulgent parents (who like Apes, many times kill

                     <p>Secondly, another reaſon is, when the drink is in, the wit is out: and ſo having loſt the ſtern of reaſon, hee is apt to ſay or doe any thing hee can ſtand to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, except vertue, a meere ſtranger to him.</p>
                     <p>And it ſhall go hard but he will either give offence, or take it: for having once fallen out with his owne wits, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (that one goes one way, and another another way) he can agree with no body, but becomes raging mad, as a heathen hath it in <hi>Salomons</hi> words.

When the belly is filled with drinke, then is the heart inflamed with luſt, and the eyes ſo filled with adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23461:37"/>that they cannot but gaze upon ſtrange women, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhewes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.33. whereas love, ſaith <hi>Crates,</hi> is cured with hunger.</p>
                     <p>You know when the Iron is hot, the Smith can faſhion it to his pleaſure: and wine tempers the heart like wax, for the divels impreſſion: when a man is drunk, Sathan may ſtamp in his heart the fouleſt ſinne, but luſt will admit no denyall. Yea, drunkenneſſe inflames the ſoule, and fills that with luſts as hot as hell; high diet is adulteries nurſe. They roſe up in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like fed Horſes, ſaith the Prophet, (and what followes, every man neighed after his neighbours wife) <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.8. which is more then true with us, for drunkards like the Horſe and Mule which have no underſtanding, no ſhame, no conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially your brazen brain'd, and flinty foreheaded clownes, can no ſooner ſpie a woman, or maide, chaſt, or unchaſt, even in the open ſtreets, but they will fall to imbraceing and tempting her with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry, ſcurrility, &amp; turning every vvord ſhe ſpeakes to ſome laſcivious &amp; obſcene ſenſe, vvhereof they are not a little proud, though it vvould make a vviſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt

And the Divell ſhould forget both his office and malice, if hee did not play the pander to Concupiſcence, this way for idleneſſe, makes way for looſe company; looſe company, makes way for wine; wine, makes way for luſt; and luſt makes worke for the Devill; <hi>Venus</hi> comes out of the froth of this Sea.</p>
                     <p>I will never believe that chaſtity ever ſlept in the Drunkards bed; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cannot ſay that every whormon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is given to drunkenneſſe; yet I may truely ſay, that there are no Drunkards

                     <p>This ſinne fills the heart, and eye (both eyes) if not the whole life, with horrible filthineſſe, naturall, unnaturall, any: this is ſo cleare a truth, that darkneſſe it ſelfe ſaw and confeſt it; even a Poet of the Heathens could call eating and drinking the fuell that maintaines the fier of Luſt; for Luſt, ſaith hee, is quenched by abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, kindled by exceſſe, and nothing ſooner kills this tetter then that faſting ſpittle of abſtinence; for how ſhould the wieke burne without tallow, or the lampe without oyle?</p>

                     <p>Yea, wee finde this and a great deale more by experience: for many a man drinkes himſelfe out of his wits, and out of his wealth, and out of his credit, and out of all grace and favour, both with God and good men.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23461:41"/>As let the Drunkard have but a groate, it burnes in his purſe till it be drowned in drinke; if hee have gold, he will change it; if plate, hee will pawne it; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then not ſatisfie his gut, away goes all to the coate on his backe; yea, rather then hee will ſcant (as they ſay) his belly, had hee a jewell as rich as tenne Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, or as <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> was, that woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſwaggerer, his throate ſhall have it.

Or, ſuppoſe he bee a labouring man, and muſt earne it before he have it, he will drinke as much in a day (ſaith <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi>) as hee can get in a weeke, ſpend twelve pence ſooner, then earne two pence.

                     <p>Thus the Drunkard having ſpent all in ſuperfluities, in the end hee wants neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and becauſe in youth hee will drinke nothing but wine, in his old age

                     <p>Yea, it bringeth a ſcandall upon all that profeſſe the ſame Religion with him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                     <p>Yea, the Apoſtle tells us that their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23461:45"/>workes of darkneſſe which are done of of them in ſecret, are ſo ſhamefull, that it is a ſhame even to ſpeak of them, or once name them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11, 12.

                     <p>Thus drunkards by their drinking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much hurt; ſome, in their bodies; ſome, in their braines; ſome, in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, whilſt they are called from their callings; ſome, in their names, whiles buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with drinke, they are laid out to bee ſunned and ſcorn'd; ſome, in their chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whilſt they are uſed as <hi>Lots</hi> daughters did their father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may ſerve to have beene ſpoken of his outward parts. Now of his inward, and more odious qualities; for although the drunkards ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſtrife, ſhame, poverty, and diſeaſes, together with his untimely death, as one would thinke, were enough to make this ſin odious: yet looke we further into him, as namely, into his more inward parts, his ſecret abominations, which follow and are occaſioned through drunkennes; that will make it hidious, and fearefull, at leaſt

We learne to doe ill, by doing what is next it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and hence it is, that vice ſo fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in our Gentry and ſervingmen, who have nothing to employ themſelves in.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Rome,</hi> that during the time of their warres with <hi>Carthage</hi> and other enemies in <hi>Africa,</hi> they knew not what vices meant; but no ſooner had they got the conqueſt, then through idleneſſe they came to ruine. Ruſt, you know, will fret into the hardeſt iron, if it bee not uſed; Moſſe will grow on the ſmoatheſt ſtone, if it bee not ſtirred; Mothes will conſume the fineſt garment, if it bee not worne: ſo vice will infect even the beſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23461:46"/>heart, if given to idleneſſe. Standing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſooner frozen, then the running ſtreame; hee that ſitteth is more ſubject to ſleepe, then hee that walketh: ſo the idle man is farre more ſubject to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then hee that is profitably exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: yea, idleneſſe (ſaith one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) is the Devills onely opportunity; for if hee come, and finds us well buſied, hee leaves us for that time, as having ſmall hope to prevaile.</p>
                     <p>An idle perſon is good for nothing but to propagate ſinne,
<note place="margin">Idleneſſe the moſt corrupting Fly that can blow in any humane minde.</note> to bee a factor for the Devill: it faring with man, as with the earth of which hee was made; which, if it bee not tilled, or trimmed, doth not onely remaine unfruitfull, but alſo breeds and brings forth Bryers, Brambles, Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and all manner of noyſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable things: ſo that <hi>Seneca</hi> ſeemes to be miſtaken, in calling an idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the image of death; for though the body be idle, yet the ſoule, like a river, is alwayes in progreſſion, and his heart, like a wherry, either goes forward or backward, It may be reſembled to a well with two buckets; the mind no ſooner empties it ſelfe of good thoughts, but it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23461:47"/>fills with evill cogitations. If the ſeede dyes, the blade ſprings; the death of grace, is but the birth of corruption.</p>
                     <p>Now all the Drunkard's labour,
<note place="margin">All the drunkards labour is to ſctisfie his Luſts.</note> is to ſatisfie his Luſts; and all his life, nought elſe but a viciſſitude of devouring and venting: as how many of them make it their trade and whole vocation to keepe company. Whereas ſweat, either of the Brow or of the Braine, is the deſtiny of all trades, be they mentall or manuall; for God never allowed any man to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Are not moſt populous places, by reaſon of this vice, like <hi>Antiochus</hi> his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, fuller of mouthes then hands? for, if you marke it, the company keeper and good fellowe (according to the vulgar) is the barroneſt peece of earth in all the Orbe; the Common wealth hath no more uſe of him, then <hi>Ieroboham</hi> had of his withered hand; hee is like the dumbe Iacke in a Virginall, for he hath not ſo much as a voice in the common wealth.</p>
                     <p>Whereas hee was borne for the good of his countrey, friends, family, &amp;c. well may hee diſturbe the common wealth, and give offence and ſcandall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that are neere or about him, <hi>Rom.</hi>

                     <p>What is recorded of <hi>Margites,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee never plowed, nor digged, nor did any thing all his life long that might tend to any good, is truly verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, hee is not more nimble tongu'd then gowty handed (as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate confeſt of himſelfe, and yet never
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23461:48"/>thinkes hee ſhall give an account for this ſinne of all the reſt: but ſurely, if wee muſt give an account for every idle word, much more for every idle day, nay moneth, nay yeare. But I proceede. All the paines hee takes is for the enemy of mankinde: if you will have him worke, you muſt chaine him in a celler, where are good ſtore of ſprings, and give him the option or choice, whether hee will pumpe or drowne: which is the <hi>Hollanders</hi> way to dreſſe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe ill demeanour hath made unworthy to live.</p>
                     <p>The company keeper is like a top, which alwayes runnes round, but never goes forward, unleſſe it be whipt: or the Mill wheele, which turnes about all day, but at night remaines in the ſame place: or like a blind Horſe in a maltmill, which is as farre in the morning as at night, for all the day hee walkes round in the ſame circle, over and over; and when he hath done, and ſlept a little, is new to begin againe.</p>
                     <p>Neither does hee, which walkes from ſix to ſix in <hi>Paules,</hi> goe more then a coytes caſt before him, Drunkards make
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23461:48"/>it their whole imployment, to goe from theirs beds to the tap houſe, (for the true Drunkard thinkes no wine good, which is brought over two threſholds) from the taphouſe to the play houſe, where they make a match for the brothelhouſe, and from thence to bed againe: ſo that they either doe nothing, or that which is worſe then nothing: for hee is neither a Drunkard, nor an idle perſon, but a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, compleat, and well qualified Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that ſpends the whole day, yea every day, but in bouſing, and bowling, and taking Tobacco.</p>
                     <p>O the number of men and women in this City, that are all the day idle, yet have not an idle hower to afford either the Church, or the ſtudy, or for the good of the common wealth! And therefore no wonder if they afford not mee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they onlie ſit to eate, and drinke, lye downe to ſleepe, and riſe up to play; this is all their exerciſe, herein lyes all their worth, and no marvell, for if the world be a mans god, pleaſure muſt needs bee his Religion.</p>
                     <p>They are juſt like ſo many Gnats, for as Gnats doe nothing but play up and

                     <p>Drink diſapparells the ſoule, and is the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23461:51"/>betrayer of the mind; it turnes the key of the tongue, and makes it unlocke that counſell, which before wiſdome had in keeping; even the thoughts of the heart, which God hath ſecluded from the very Divell, by this do ſuffer a ſearch.

                     <p>I confeſſe, there is no generall rule but admits of ſome exceptions; and this rule is not alwayes infallible: for wine makes ſome quick ſpirited, others dull; this man talkative, another dumb; according to the diſpoſition and conſtitution of the party.

                     <p>And all this hee ſets out with the ſame throat, that a hired waterman cryes <hi>Cales</hi> ſand: for commonly a lewd tongue, is a lowd one; and a lowd tongue, a lewd one. Impudent ſpeakers are like gaping Oyſters; which being open'd, either ſtink, or there is nothing in them.</p>
                     <p>But to keepe cloſe to drunkards. This <hi>Caca-daemons</hi> diſcourſe is all quarrelling, ſcoffing, or ſcurrilous; for as hee hath a ſpitefull tongue in his anger, ſo he hath a beaſtly tongue in his mirth; as theſe two inſeparably attend each other.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a <hi>ſpitefull tongue</hi> in his <hi>anger:</hi> for if you marke him then, having more rage than reaſon, hee enterlaceth all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, either with reviling the preſent, or backbiting the abſent: now all his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are curſes; and all his relations, lyes; talkative and lying, you know, are two birds, which alwayes flie out of one neſt. To be ſhort, heare him when he is in this veine, and but ſeriouſly conſider his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23461:53"/>you would thinke, that by a juſt judgement of God, hee were metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed, like <hi>Hecuba</hi> the wife of <hi>Priamus,</hi> into a Dog, whoſe chiefe property is to barke with open mouth, at ſuch as hee knowes not: for without queſtion, their wits are ſhorter, and their tongues longer, then to demonſtrate them rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he hath a <hi>beaſtly tongue</hi> in his <hi>mirth:</hi> the drunkards communication is ever filthy and beaſtly, ful of all ribaudry and baudineſſe; no filthy talke, or rotten ſpeech whatſoever comes amiſſe to a drunkard; yea, no word ſavours well with them, that is not unſavoury; their onely muſicke (and ſo fares it with all the rude rabble) is ribaudry, modeſty and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber merriment with them is dulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus whereas hee ſhould either bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or his words ſhould be better worth then ſilence; contrariwiſe, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end hee belcheth forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what is as farre from truth, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reaſon, modeſty, as that the Moone came down from heaven to viſit <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi> O the beaſtlines which burns in their unchaſt and impure minds, that ſmoakes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23461:54"/>out of their polluted mouthes! A man would thinke, that even the Divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhould bluſh, to heare his child ſo talke. How doth his mouth runne over with falſehoods, againſt both Chriſtians and Preachers? what ſpeakes hee leſſe then whoredomes, adulteries, inceſts, at every word? yea, heare two or three of them talke, you would change the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caonians</hi> language, and ſay, Devills are come up in the likeneſſe of men.</p>
                     <p>Yea, it is a ſmall matter with them to meddle with their equalls, or to ſit upon their pariſh Prieſt (as thoſe hogſheads terme him) for in ſuch a meeting they will viſit a whole Dioceſſe, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; nay, the ſageſt Iudge, and graveſt Counceller, and greateſt Peere in the land, muſt doe ſervice to their Court, and be ſummoned before the Alebench; according to that in the <hi>Pſalmes, they ſet their mouthes against Heaven, and their tongues walke through the earth, Pſal.</hi> 73.9.</p>
                     <p>Nor will they ſtay here; for when they have huft their ſmoake into the face of theſe, they will have a health to King <hi>Charles;</hi> and what not, for the honour of <hi>England?</hi> O that they ſhould dare to

                     <p>Yea, the Drunkards and deſperate ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians of our dayes, ſweare and curſe, as if Heaven were deafe to their noyſe; yea, they have ſo ſworne away all grace, that they count it a grace to ſweare: and that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23461:55"/>not onely when they are diſpleaſed with others, will they tare the name of their Maker in peeces, which is no better then frenzie; but in their very beſt moodes. Prophane Drunkards ſweare, even as dogs barke, not ever for curſtneſſe, but moſtly out of cuſtome: neither know they that they ſweare, though they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſweare; as you ſhall heare a man, when reproved for ſwearing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently rap out oathes, that he ſwore not, like men deſperately diſeaſed, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements and filth comes from them at unawares. And as by much labour the hand is ſo hardened, that it hath no ſenſe of labour: ſo their much ſwearing cauſeth ſuch a brawny skin of ſenſeleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to overſpread the heart, memory, and conſcience, that the ſwearer ſweareth unwittingly; and having ſworne hath no remembrance of his oath, much leſſe, repentance for his ſinne.</p>
                     <p>O the numberleſſe number of oathes and blaſphemies that one blacke mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Drunkard ſpits out in defiance, as it were, of God, and all prohibitions to the contrary! Yea, I dare affirme it, had ſome one of them three thouſand pounds <hi>per
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23461:55"/>Annum,</hi> his meanes would hardly pay thoſe ſmall twelve penny multes, which our Statute impoſes upon ſwearers, were it duly executed. And if ſo, to what number wil the oathes amount, which are ſworne throughout the whole land, yea, in ſome one Alehouſe, or Taverne? where they ſit all day in troopes, doing that in earneſt, which wee have ſeene boyes doe in ſport, ſtand on their heads, and ſhake their heeles againſt Heaven: where even to heare how the name of the Lord Ieſus is pierced, would make a dumbe man ſpeake, a dead man almoſt to quake. Did you never heare how <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was uſed in the Senate houſe? if not, yet you know how a kennell of Hounds will fall upon the poore Hare; one, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the head; another, the leg; a third, the throate; and amongſt them ſhee is torne in peeces: even ſo theſe hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh miſcreants, theſe bodily and viſible Devills, having their tongues fired and edged from Hell, fall upon the Lord <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> one cryes, Wounds; another, Blood; a third, Heart; a fourth, Body; a fifth, Soule; and never leave ſtabbing and tearing him with their ſtinges, till no whole place be left.</p>

                     <p>Thus they pierce his ſide with oathes, and teare all his wounds open againe; whereas the <hi>Iewes</hi> did but crucifie him below on the earth, when hee came to ſuffer; theſe crucifie him above in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where hee ſits on his throne.</p>
                     <p>And (which I feare to thinke) it may bee a queſtion, whether there bee more oathes broken or kept: for woe is mee; one, ſells an oath for a bribe; another, lends an oath for favour; another, caſts it away for malice &amp;c. but the Drunkard, without any incitement, tumbleth out oathes at adventure, and is as laviſh of them, as of ill language. O miſery! O wickedneſſe!

But as for prime Chriſtians, viz. the auncient Fathers, their labours, their learning, their ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to men, and devotion to God, was the wonder of the world: whereas all the difference betweene theſe, and very infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells, is, only this; the one are infidells in their hearts, the other are infidells in their lives, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> pithily.

<note place="margin">Of which two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> I ſay of all other ſinnes, this is the <hi>moſt inexcuſeable,</hi> becauſe, it is an evill, from which, of all evills, wee have moſt <hi>power of abſtinence.</hi> As let him that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo much accuſtomed to ſwearing, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit hee hath habituated errors into man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) be in place where he is afraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, or ſure to pay twelve pence for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oath; he can wholly forbeare, or if he doe chance to forget himſelfe once or twice; yet he will not ſweare one oath for an hundred, which he would doe, in other company, and where it would coſt him nothing. Now the eaſier the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is, the greater guilt in the breach
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23461:60"/>of it; and the lighter the injunction, the heavier the tranſgreſſion, ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or ſuppoſe thou pretendeſt thou haſt beene ſo long accuſtomed to it, that thou canſt not leave it; yet this is but a witleſſe, graceleſſe, and ſhameleſſe excuſe. For firſt, cuſtome of ſinne is the very heigth of ſinne: and nothing more aggravates it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, will a thiefe or murtherer at the Barre alledge for his excuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that it hath beene his uſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of a long time? or if hee doe, will not the judge ſo much the rather ſend him to the Gallowes?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe it is a ſin, to which of all other ſinnes wee have the <hi>feweſt temptations:</hi> for whereas other ſins have commonly ſome ſenſible profit to mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife them into the world; as the Uſurer finds an increaſe of wealth, who deſires to live with leſſe faith, and more ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or pleaſure, as the Adulterer finds his ſtoln bread of Sathans ſeaſoning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding far ſweeter, then what God hath given him of his owne; or credit, as the Hypocrite findes, who, like that Romane Woolfe, talkes of Religion, when hee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:23461:61"/>meanes policy, and playes the foule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, under the ſhape of an Angel of light, and may be reſembled to an ugly Toade in an Ivory box, or a painted pot full of deadly poyſon. Theſe and many other ſinners, which I could name, have ſome inducement to provoke them, ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to alledge; (indeed they are all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Divels Lectures) but the <hi>ſwearer</hi> hath <hi>nothing to provoke</hi> him, nor nothing to ſay, but that he loves this ſin, becauſe it is a ſin, and becauſe God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it; which is moſt fearefull and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and (as a man would thinke) ſhould make it unpardonable; I am ſure, this makes it inexcuſable. For what haſt thou to ſay for thy ſelfe? this ſinne is neither pleaſing, nor profitable, nor laudable, but hath a more pure corruption and venome in it, then any of his fellowes, and muſt needs iſſue from meere malice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God; for all thou canſt expect by it, is, the ſuſpition of a common lyer, by being a common ſwearer.</p>
                     <p>Yea, thou canſt but procure this fruit by thy ſwearing, that thou ſhalt vex o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they ſhall hate thee: which thews that thou delighteſt in evill, meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23461:61"/>becauſe it is evill; as ſinne is more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up and irritated by the Law; yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition inciteth, and reſtraint inviteth a deſperate wicked wretch, and his nature moſt deſireth what is forbidden. As it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Eve,</hi> and that Gentleman in <hi>Venice,</hi> who while it was left to his owne free choyce, in ninety yeares together ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went forth of the Citie; but being hereupon confined, and that upon paine of death, was obſerved a while after to ride much abroad. <hi>Sinne,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>tooke occaſion by the commandement, Romans</hi> 7.11. as if mans nature delighted in this or that evill ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law forbids them. Yea, moſt finde it here in, as in matters of bookes, which being once called in, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, become more ſaleable and publike. The Dictates of the law being to ſinfull luſts in mans heart, as water to quicke lime, a meanes to inkindle them, and make them boyle the more fiercely.</p>
                     <p>But know this thou ſwearer, that he is bottomleſly ill, who loves vice becauſe it is vice; he is a deſperate, prodigious, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wretch, and full of the venome of the ſerpent, that will (rather then not dye)

Yea, this proves thee worſe then an Oxe led to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for hereby thou becommeſt thine owne executioner.</p>
                     <p>Alaſſe! thou art not of thy ſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſerve, or to name him; how then dareſt thou to make him, and his Name to ſerve thee, thy prophane diſcourſe, and thy raſh, and untempered anger?</p>

                     <p>For what's the uſe they would make of Gods judgments in the like caſes?

                     <p>Or let their purſes pay for it, and this would touch them to the quicke, this is a tryed remedy, the land hath had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, when there was an act made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and his Parliament, that if any Duke ſwore an oath, hee ſhould pay forty ſhillings; a Barron, twenty ſhillings; a Knight or an Eſquire, ten ſhillings; a Yeoman, three ſhillings foure pence; a Servant, whipt; and the ſame as well executed, as inacted, no man was once heard to ſweare, or very rarely.

                     <p>Or thirdly, ſo abundantly <hi>talkative,</hi> that they prove themſelves <hi>fooles</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; for even their much babling, is an argument ſufficient to prove them fooles.

                     <p>Yea, tell me whether a talkative drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard bee not an unbraced <hi>Drum,</hi> able to beate a wiſe man out of his wits, except he ſhould ſtop his eares, or abſent his perſon, when ſuch intrude themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his company.</p>

                     <p>Believe it, if a man drink too much for his purſe, too much for his calling and occaſions, too much for his health and quiet of body and mind, <hi>Salomon</hi> cals him a drunkard.</p>

                     <p>Yea, God is ſo farre from being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector of perſons in the diſpenſing of his grace, that as <hi>he hath put downe the mighty from their ſeates, and exalted them of low degree;</hi> ſo <hi>he hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich hee hath ſent empty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> Luk. 1.52.53. <hi>he hath choſen the poore of this world to be rich in faith,</hi> James 2.5. yea, <hi>not many noble are called,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>but God hath choſen the baſe things of the world, and things that are deſpiſed, to confound the mighty,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26, 27.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this the manner of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

                     <p>But ſuppoſe God did make a difference between rich and poore, great and ſmall, noble and ignoble; yet ſtill greatneſſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and riches would be but a deceitful guide or rule to walke by; <hi>for the Kings of the earth band themſelves, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are aſſembled together, againſt the Lord and against his Chriſt, Pſalme</hi> 2.2. and in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.26. we read of no leſſe then 32 Kings in a cluſter which were every one drunke; and elſewhere, that a thouſand

And laſtly, when the Rulers ſate in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell againſt Chriſt, none ſpake for him but <hi>Nichodemus, Ioh.</hi> 7.50, 51.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:23461:98"/>as the errors of the eminent are eminent errors, and the more noble the perſon, the more notorious the corruption; for great Perſons, like the great lights of Heaven, the moſt conſpicuous planets, if they be eclipſed, all the <hi>Almanacks</hi> of all nations write of it; whereas the ſmall Starres of the <hi>Galaxy</hi> are not heeded; all the country runnes to a Beakon on fire, no body regards to ſee a ſhrub flaming in a valley; whereby ſinne in them, is not onely ſinne, but <hi>ſubornatione quae in Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garibus nugae, in Magnatibus blaſphemia:</hi> ſo theſe great offenders, ſhall meete with great puniſhments; and as their fault is according to the condition of their place, ſo ſhall the nature and proportion of their retribution be.</p>

                     <p>Alaſſe! the greateſt Clarkes, and they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:23461:102"/>that know moſt, are not always the wiſeſt men; many of the wiſe, and the ancient, and the learned, with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> are to learne this leſſon, that <hi>except they be borne againe, they cannot enter into the kingdome of Heaven, Iohn.</hi> 3.4, 9. and they that give themſelves to be ſo bookiſh, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times ſo blockiſh, that they forget God who made them.</p>
                     <p>Now as our Saviour ſaid to him, which thought he had done all, <hi>One thing is behind, Luk.</hi> 18.22. ſo may I ſay to theſe, who thinke they know all, one thing is behinde, and that is the true knowledge of God, of Chriſt, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and how they may be ſaved: and hee which knowes not thus much, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I cannot ſay he is a ſtarke foole, yet I may truely ſay hee is halfe a foole, and halfe a wiſe man: as <hi>Ona-Centaure</hi> was halfe a man, and halfe an Aſſe: for all learning and knowledge, without this, is but as a wodden Diamond in a Lattin ring, and others who know leſſe, and are leſſe learned, may be more wiſe.</p>
                     <p>It was a true and juſt reprehenſion, wherewith the High Prieſt ſnib'd the Councell, as they were ſet to condemne

What ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> no more then the knowledge of goodneſſe, maketh one to be named a good man; no more doth the knowledge of wiſdome, onely, cauſe any perſon properly to bee called a wiſe man; ſaving knowledge of the trueth, workes a love of the trueth knowne: yea, it is an uniforme conſent of knowledge and action: hee onely is wiſe, that is wiſe for his owne ſoule; he whoſe conſcience pulleth all hee heares and reades to his heart, and his heart to God, who turneth his knowledg to faith, his faith to feeling, and all to walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Redeemer, he that ſubdues his ſenſuall deſires and appetites to the more noble faculties of reaſon, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and makes that underſtanding of his ſerve him, by whom it is, and doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, he that ſubdues his luſts to his will, ſubmits his will to reaſon, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to faith, his faith, his reaſon, his will, himſelfe, to the will of God; this is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23461:103"/>experimentall, and ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to which the other is but a bare name or title: for what is the notionall ſweetneſſe of honey, to the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall taſt of it. It is one thing to know what riches are, and where they be, and another thing to be maſter of them; it is not the knowing, but the poſſeſſing of them that makes rich.</p>
                     <p>Faith and Holineſſe are the nerves and ſinewes, yea the ſoule of ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: the beſt knowledge is about the beſt things, and the perfection of all knowledge, to know God and our ſelves, as being the marrow, pith, or kernell, of Chriſtianity; and it is much, to know a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in this kinde.

                        </gap>a precious ſtone is a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing, yet it is preferred before many other ſtones of greater bulke: yea, a little Diamond is more worth then a rockie mountaine: ſo one drop of wiſdome, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the feare of God, is more worth
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23461:104"/>then all humane learning; one ſparke of ſpiritual, experimental, and ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is worth a whole flame of ſecular wiſdome and learning; one ſcruple of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, one drame of faith, one graine of grace, is more worth then many pounds of naturall parts.</p>
                     <p>But learning and grace do not alwayes keepe company together: yea, oh Lord how many are there that have a depth of knowledge, yet are not ſoule wiſe! that have a library of Divinity in their heads, and not ſo much as the leaſt catechiſme in their conſciences! No rare thing for men to abound in ſpeculation, and be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in devotion; to have full braines, and empty hearts; clear judgement, and defiled affections; fluent tongues, but lame feet; yea, you ſhall heare a flood in the tongue, when you cannot ſee one drop in the life.</p>
                     <p>But ſee how juſtly they are ſerved; they might bee holy, and will not; therefore though they would bee ſoule wiſe, yet they ſhall not; <hi>the ſcorner ſeeketh wiſdome, but findeth it not, Pro.</hi> 14.6.

For although Reaſon was ſo cleare in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, that he could ſee good from evill perfectly; yet ſince it hath caught a fall, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> did, and ſo halteth, that it is not wholly to be relied upon; how be it, becauſe it is of the blood Royall, it is worthy to be made off; but not worthy to ſit in the throne of judgment, which belongs onely to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>David,</hi> whoſe word is trueth it ſelfe. But to goe on.</p>
                     <p>There is no man commits ſo <hi>foule a fact,</hi> though ſhallow brain'd in other things, but hee hath <hi>piouſible Reaſons</hi> to make it good, as <hi>Abſolom,</hi> for lying with his fathers concubines, in the ſight of all the people, having helpe from <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.21. and <hi>Haman,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing that bloody decree againſt all the <hi>Iewes;</hi> for hee makes many glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, <hi>Eſter.</hi> 3.8.9.</p>
                     <p>Neither was ever any <hi>vertue performed</hi> ſo ſplendent and glorious, but there hath beene <hi>Reaſon</hi> brought to prove it faulty, at leaſt, in appearance; witneſſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours caſting out Devills, which the

How ſafe then and happy is the man, that is reſolved to doe nothing without God; who commands all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both in Heaven, Earth, and Hell, and they obey him? the conſideration of which made <hi>Luther</hi> ſo couragious, that (being perſwaded by his friends to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe from the Diet at <hi>Wormes</hi>) hee made anſwer, though all the tyles of the houſes were ſo many Divells, yet would I goe thether: he knew he ſhould have more, and mightier with him, then againſt him, being in his way, that is, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a warrant out of the Word for what

                     <p>Let the ſame conſideration prevaile with us. Have wee a <hi>warrant</hi> out of the word? are wee in the path of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection? in the way wherein the Angels

                     <p>On the other ſide: if God take no charge of us, but when wee are in our wayes, yea, in his, by having a warrant out of the Word; how are they in their wayes, who ſpend their whole time in drinking, ſwearing, whoring? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who perſecute the godly, for keeping cloſe to this Word?

                     <p>Generallity of aſſent is no warrant for any act: we that are Chriſtians muſt not live by prophane examples, but by Gods holy precepts. Indeed, common

                     <p>I confeſſe, where the Law written doth faile, we ought to obſerve what is approved by manners and cuſtome: but though, in this caſe, cuſtome be of great authority, yet it never brings prejudice to a manifeſt verity: and there are other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherein ſingularity is not lawfull on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but laudable; when vice groweth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faſhion, ſingularity is a vertue; when ſanctity is counted ſingularity, happy is he that goeth alone, and reſolves to be an <hi>Example</hi> to others; and when either e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is to be done, or good to be neglected, how much better is it to goe the right way alone, then to erre with company?

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:23461:129"/>his caſe for deſperately forlorne, and ſo diſinherited him; becauſe this ſinne, hee knew, increaſed with age, and would not part till death.</p>
                     <p>A Gameſter will hold out, ſo long as his purſe laſts: an Adulterer, ſo long as his loynes laſt; but a <hi>drunkard,</hi> ſo long as his lungs and life laſts. What is noted by Philoſophers of every motion, namely, that it is ſwifteſt toward the Center; may fitly bee applyed to every drunkard, and covetous wretch; for as good men grow better and better, ſo theſe <hi>grow worſe and worſe, Ier.</hi> 9.3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. they grow in ſinne, as worldlings grow in riches and honours. O that we could grow ſo faſt in grace.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſuppoſe the drunkard hath every day <hi>purpoſes</hi> to <hi>forſake</hi> his ſinne; as I have knowne ſome <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>ſtrive</hi> againſt this ſinne, yea ſo deteſt and bewaile it in himſelfe, and whomſoever, that it hath been an <hi>Hazael</hi> in his eyes, and thereupon indent with himſelfe and his friends, for the relinquiſhing of it; and yet if he meete with a companion that holds but up his finger, he followes him, <hi>as a foole to the flockes,</hi> and as an Oxe to the ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:23461:129"/>having no power to withſtand the temptation, but in hee goes with him to the tipling houſe, and there hee continues as one bewitched or conjured with a ſpell, out of which he returnes not, till he hath emptied his purſe of money, his head of reaſon, and his heart of al his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeeming grace: ſo that in purpoſing he doth but imitate S. <hi>George,</hi> who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on horſeback, but never rides; or the Oſtrich, that hath winges, but cannot fly: he may make a ſhew of turning, as the doore upon the hinges, but never moves a foot from the poſt of his old cuſtom and evill ſociety, unto which hee is faſt revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo mends as ſower Ale doth in Summer; or like a dead hedge, which the longer it ſtands, is the rottener.</p>
                     <p>O this is a difficult divel to be caſt out; for when a man is once poſſeſt with this evill ſpirit, a drunken divell, it is a miracle if ever hee become his owne man after.

As it fares with ſome ſicke Patients, touching their bodies; who think as good be buried, as ſo much debarred of their appetites: ſo fares it with theſe, touching their ſoules; for uſe what meanes you will to reclame them, they will reject it.</p>
                     <p>What ſaith S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſhall we ſpeake to drunkards, wee had as good round a dead man in the eare? yea, certainly, ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is drunk himſelfe, that prophanes reaſon ſo, as to urge it to a drunken man; in regard whereof, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares drunkenneſſe to the pit of hell, into which when a man is once fallen, there is no redemption.

                     <p>NEither ſpeak I of what God can do,
<note place="margin">Were there any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine in the heate of the plague.</note> for with him all things are poſſible; but with men, with drunkards, it is in a manner impoſſible: for ſurely if there were the leaſt poſſibility of their leaving it, if they were not altogether hardened, paſt feeling, and paſt grace, then would they <hi>now abſtaine,</hi> whilſt the <hi>plague</hi> is hot amongſt us. But alaſſe! even at this preſent, when many lawfull and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent actions are unexpedient, theſe warped, wicked, wretched men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare, nor ceaſe to roare, drinke, drab, ſweare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo difficult is the work: like <hi>Iairus</hi> Minſtrels, they cannot forbeare to play and revell, even in the time, and place of mourning; <hi>Dives</hi>-like, they muſt have exquiſite muſick, merry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, dainty fare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every day; ſo little are they mooved with Gods diſpleaſure, and this grievous judgement.</p>
                     <p>Yea, notwithſtanding it is for their ſakes that judgements are upon us, and that their crying ſinnes have pierced the heavens, and brought downe the Plague upon thouſands, as when <hi>Achan</hi> ſinned, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:23461:132"/>was beaten; neither did the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Peor</hi> ſtretch ſo far as the Plague; yea, the Adultery of thoſe few <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to the Levites wife, was the occaſion of ſix and twenty thouſand mens deaths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all their wives and children, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with forty thouſand and odd of the <hi>Iſraelites, Iudg.</hi> 20. when the death of thoſe few malefactors would have ſaved all theirs, and put away evill from <hi>Iſrael, verſ.</hi> 13. yea, if the Campe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much for one <hi>Achan's</hi> fault; what may wee expect, that have ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Achans</hi> amongſt us?</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, I ſay it is for their ſakes that judgements are upon us; yet they, of al men are leaſt ſenſible of them; as it fared with <hi>Ionas,</hi> who for all that grievous tempeſt was for his ſake, yet <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> alone was faſt aſleep; and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in another caſe; as wherefore was that unſpeakable agony of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but for the ſinnes of his Diſciples, and choſen? and yet even then the Diſciples were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe.</p>
                     <p>But why doe I make the compariſon, when betweene them there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon? for the fire of Gods wrath being
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23461:132"/>kindled amongſt us for their ſakes, they doe but warme themſelves at the flame, ſining ſo much the more freely and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, even drinking in iniquity, as the fiſh drinketh in water; and living, as if they were neither beholding to God, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him, both out of his debt and danger: yea: as if the Plague were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome unto them, but they would fall to courting of their owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if, with <hi>Calanus,</hi> they hated to dye a naturall death.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure of the world is like that <hi>Colchian</hi> hony, whereof <hi>Zenophon's</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers no ſooner taſted, then they were miſerably diſtempered; thoſe that tooke little, were drunk; thoſe that took more, were mad; thoſe that tooke moſt, were dead: ſo moſt men are either intoxicated, or infatuated, or killed out right with this deceitfull world, that they are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their feares or dangers. It is like a kind of melancholy, called <hi>Chorus Sancti Viti,</hi> which who ſo hath it, can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but laugh and dance, untill they be dead, or cured; as it made <hi>Argos</hi> in the Poet, and another, mentioned by <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> ſit all day laughing and clapping their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23461:133"/>hands, as if they had beene upon a ſtage at a Theater.</p>
                     <p>Wickedneſſe makes guilty men feare, where is no cauſe; theſe have cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but no grace to feare: they are ſo beſotted with a ſtupid ſecurity, that they are not affected with any danger; yea, they account it the chiefeſt vertue, to be bold, feareleſſe, and careleſſe; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. where the Prophet complaines unto God, <hi>thou haſt ſmitten them, but they have no tſorrowed; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive correction; they have made their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces harder then a ſtone, and have refuſed to returne, verſe,</hi> 3. which was <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> caſe, who though his backe were all blew and ſore with ſtripes, yet he muſt ſtill perſiſt and preſume; yea, becauſe his time was not come to periſh, God lets him alone in purſuing his children, even to the Sea, and halfe way over; faire way he had, and ſmoothly he ran on, till he came to the midſt, not ſo much as one wave to wet the foote of his Horſe; but when he is too farre to eſcape, then God begins to ſtrike, neither he could, nor theſe can be quiet, without their full
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:23461:133"/>vengeance; as filching leaves not the Pilferer with raw ſides, but brings him to a broaken necke; they have ſuch feſtred and putrified hearts, that ordinary ſtripes will not reach to the quicke; their long tugging at Sathans Oares, and wearing his Shackels, hath ſo brawned their fleſh, that they are not ſenſible of an ordinary laſh. And this likewiſe is the Saylers caſe, who although the Philoſopher would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be numbred amongſt the living, (as not amongſt the dead) yet for all their many and eminent dangers, no men are more regardleſſe of their ſoules.</p>

                     <p>Yea, this <hi>hardneſſ of heart</hi> and <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> is alwayes the <hi>harbinger</hi> to ſome ſearefull <hi>plague, Iſay,</hi> 6.10.11.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:23461:134"/>judgement, of an <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>impenitent heart:</hi> and what doth <hi>impenitency,</hi> but turne all deliverances into further curſes and judgements? ſo that ſuch a mans deliverance is a worſe judgment, then the judgment from which he is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for it argues, either Gods utter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of them, as deſperate Patients are given over by the Phyſitian; <hi>why ſhould yee be ſmitton any more, for yee fall away more and more,</hi> ſaith God to the ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked <hi>Iewes, Iſaiah,</hi> 1.5. or elſe it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a reſervation of them for ſome more fearefull plague; if by theſe former judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>yee will not be reformed by me,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>but walke ſtubbornely against me; then I will walke stubbornely againſt you, and ſmite you yet ſeven times more for your ſins: Lev.</hi> 26.18. to 40. So that an impenitent mans preſervation out of one judgment, is but a further reſervation of him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven judgments. What did it availe <hi>Cham,</hi> that he eſcaped drowning with the multitude? he had better have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the waters, then have lived unto his Fathers curſe? What did it availe <hi>Lot's</hi> wife, to eſcape turning into aſhes in <hi>Sodom,</hi> when ſuddenly after ſhe was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:23461:135"/>into a pillar of ſalt in the plaine? Or what did it availe <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was not ſmitten with many of thoſe judgements, wherein others periſhed? it was farre from being a mercy; yea, it was a reſervation to the greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall judgment of all here, and to that eternall judgment alſo in the burning lake, from which there is no redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that it is not ſimply our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but our thankfulneſſe for it, and obedience after it, that gives ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to our conſciences, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us in mercy and favour.</p>
                     <p>Yea, to proſper in ill deſignes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious courſes, to goe on in ſinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled, is the greateſt unhappineſſe, the heavieſt curſe: for he that uſeth to doe evill, and ſpeeds well, never reſts, till he come to that evill from which there is no redemption. <hi>Ioab</hi> kills <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and ſcapes; againe he embrues his hands in the blood of <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and is not indited for it; now <hi>David</hi> is old, and <hi>Adoniah</hi> towardly, he furthers him in the uſurpation, and big with prefidence of his owne command, he thinkes to carry it; but this carryed him to his grave.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:23461:135"/>Faire <hi>Abſalom</hi> was proud and ambitious, yet he flouriſheth; hee kills his owne Brother, yet eſcapes; he inſinuates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the affections of the people, and bold of their fidelity to him, he ſwels even againſt his owne royall Father, and becomes a diſloyall Traytor. God owes that man a grievous paiment, whom he ſuffers to runne on ſo long unqueſtioned; and his puniſhment ſhall be the greater, when he comes to reckon with him for all his faults together. Yea, though proſperous wickedneſſe is one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills ſtrongeſt chaines, yet the currant paſſage of ill enterpriſes is ſo farre from giving cauſe of encouragement, that it ſhould juſtly fright a man, to looke backe to the Author, and to conſider, that he therefore goes faſt, becauſe the Devill drives him.</p>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:23461:136"/>and upon the necke of that, great favour and mercy. As in the booke of <hi>Iudges,</hi> and elſewhere, what a continued circle doe we finde, of Peace, Sinnes, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Repentance, Deliverances: the converſation of Gods people with the wicked, tainted them with ſinne, their ſinnes drew on judgments, the ſmart of the judgment moved them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, upon their repentance followed ſpeedy deliverance, and upon their peace and deliverance they ſinned againe; thus it was ever, and in every age of the world, but in this her decrepit and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting age, in which Religion is become contemptible, and wherein it is a ſhame to be ſtrict and holy, in the ſervice of God.

For as they that have curſt and ſhrewiſh wives at home, love to ſtray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: ſo theſe men being moleſted with a ſcoulding conſcience, are faine conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to drinke, play, riot, goe to bed with their heads full of wine, and no ſooner awake then to it againe; ſo that their conſciences muſt knocke at the dore a thouſand times, and they are never within, or at leaſure to be ſpoke withall: indeed at laſt they muſt be met, and found by this enemy, even as <hi>Ahab</hi> was by <hi>Eliah;</hi> ſtay they never ſo long, and ſtray they never ſo farre, they muſt home at laſt; ſickneſſe will waken them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt ſpeake with them, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with his truant Scholler, after a long

                     <p>Whereas they ſhould eate, and drinke, and doe all things to the glory of God; they <hi>drinke,</hi> to this end onely, that they may the eaſier <hi>forget God,</hi> forget him in his threats, which ſticke in their ſoules after ſome Sermon; forget him in his judgments, which have taken hold of ſome of their companions; they <hi>drinke,</hi> to the end they may <hi>drowne conſcience,</hi> and put off all thoughts of death, and Hell, and to hearten and harden themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the meſſages of God, and threats of the Law; as that franticke Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition fell to tuning his Violl, when his houſe was on fire about his eares. For moſt men take no notice at all of the ſtrokes of Gods wrath, but with the mirth and madneſſe of wine and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, take away the knowledge of it, and the noyſe of conſcience when it cryes; as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:23461:144"/>the Sacrificers in the valley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> by the noyſe of Inſtruments, tooke away the cryes of their ſacrificed children: and ſo much the rather, that others may not take notice thereof; for though their conſciences be often in paine, yet they will not complaine that this ſhoe wrings them.</p>
                     <p>Their conſciences would faine ſpeake with them, but they will by no meanes heare them; whereas if they had wit, and were not paſt grace, they would both invite, and welcome this Angell, or meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinger of the Lord, ſo ſoone as the waters be troubled, with ſackcloth, aſhes, faſting, going into the houſe of mourning, and pouring forth whole Buckets of water, as is the manner of Gods people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6. But many a time is poore Chriſt (offering to be new borne in thee) thruſt into the Stable; while lewd companions, by their drinking, playes, and jeſts, take up all the beſt roomes in the Inne of thine heart.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, blind worldlings and beſotted ſinners, may call it <hi>melancholy,</hi> or what they will; but in Gods Dictionary (the holy Scriptures) it hath no ſuch name.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:23461:145"/>And they may thinke to drive it away with carnall delights, but this will not doe it: yea, letten Conſorts of muſicke be added, it ſhall not drowne the clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cryes of conſcience. Theſe are but miſerable comforters, and Phyſitians of no value, and no way a fit expiation for a griefe of this nature; neither can the world afford an expurgation of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                     <p>Alaſſe! this is but like ſome ſpritly muſicke, which though it advanceth a mans mind while it ſounds; yet leaves him more melancholy, when it is done, as <hi>Euripides</hi> obſerves. Yea, I'le appeale from your ſelves in drinke, to your ſelves in your ſober fits, whether it fares not with you, as it did with <hi>Menippus,</hi> who went downe into Hell to ſeeke content: for what is this other (in mitigating the pangs of conſcience) then as a ſaddle of gold, to a gal'd Horſe; or a draught of poyſon, to quench a mans thirſt.</p>
                     <p>Alaſſe! <hi>Let</hi> being expuls't <hi>Sodom,</hi> dranke ſomewhat freely to drive away <hi>melancholy</hi> (as we may conjecture) but what came of it? the wine made him commit inceſt, whereby he became ten
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23461:145"/>times more melancholy, then he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And ſurely, they which ſtrive to cure their preſent miſery, with preſent mirth; have not their miſery taken away, but changed, and of temporall, made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall; <hi>thou hast taken thy pleaſure,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives, therefore art thou now tormented, Luke</hi> 16.25. I love no ſuch change; I love not to cure one evill by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yea, by a worſe miſchiefe: as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks in curing one diſeaſe, cauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is worſe. And let them looke to it, for ſurely if men call for pleaſure, to pleaſe the conſcience, as the <hi>Philistins</hi> did for <hi>Sampſon</hi> to make them ſport, it will but pull downe the houſe upon their heads. No ſooner were the bellies of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniah's</hi> gueſts full of meat, and their heads full of wine; but their eares were full of clangor, their hearts of horror, the Trumpets at once proclame <hi>Salomon's</hi> Triumph, and their confuſion: the feaſts of the wicked end in terror, as it fared with <hi>Belſhazzar, Daniel</hi> chap. 5. v. 1. to 7. after the meale is done, ever comes the reckoning. Wherefore let my ſpirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come and enter into their Paradiſe, yea ever abhor to partake of their brutiſh
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:23461:146"/>pleaſures, leſt I partake of their endleſſe woes. And indeed who would buy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and miſery ſo deare? as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> anſwered <hi>Lais</hi> the harlot, when ſhe asked him ten thouſand Drachmes of money, for her company but one night; who would pay ſo deare for ſo ſhort a leaſe? as the Country man replyed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great preparation, labour, coſt, and ſtudy for a great triumph, when they told him it was to laſt but an houre: for could they have <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia</hi> to ſwallow, yea, could they drinke, with <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra,</hi> the riches of <hi>Egypt</hi> at a draught, and that upon free coſt, (which as <hi>Diogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> conceived, did adde ſweetneſſe to the wine) yet it is but a draught, and quickly downe the throat.</p>
                     <p>Yea, as vaine and comfortleſſe are all worldly joyes, when they are uſed to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the panges of conſcience, as it was for <hi>Callico</hi> to ſtuff his pillow (a braſſe pot) with ſtraw to make it ſoft.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, your charmes may, with their pleaſantneſſe, bring conſcience into ſome ſhort ſlumbers; but it waketh eftſoones, and in ſpite of all your ſpells, rageth as before. Yea, if but ſickneſſe come, theſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:23461:146"/>carnall delights will runne from you, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted like Rats from a houſe on fire: pleaſure, like <hi>Orpah,</hi> kiſſes, but parts; only griefe, like <hi>Ruth,</hi> weeps, and tarries with you: no joy will downe till there be hope of a pardon; ſo that no hand can heale you, but the very ſame which wounded you: the wounds of the mind can only be cured by the word of God, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what may bee ſaid, what is to bee known, what to bee believed, what to bee avoyded, yea, and what not.</p>
                     <p>Thus inſtead of repenting, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a lawfull calling, which is the only cure of Melancholy (<hi>Fulgentius</hi> aptly terming exerciſe, the death of diſeaſes, the deſtruction of all vices, and only cure of Melancholy) they adde ſinne to ſinne, leaving Gods remedies, to ſeeke remedy of the divel; whoſe office is not to quench fire, but to kindle it, even the fire of luſt, with the fire of drunkenneſſe here, and with thoſe two the fire of hell hereafter.</p>

                     <p>Indeed this is not the drunkards caſe alone, for it fares even ſo with all wicked men. Wherefore give me leave (yea let me take it) a little to ſtirre the earth about

                     <p>Wicked men as they are all the ſeed of the ſame old Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devill, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the divill, and imitate him in all things, ſo farre as corporall creatures can poſſibly do ſpirituall ſubſtances; but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in tempting to ſinne, and drawing to perdition, and ever have done, ſince the Divell their father taught them the way.

                     <p>Yet their miſtake is no more in this their challenge, then it is in the combate it ſelfe, and the <hi>victory</hi> they get by it; for whereas they make a ſport of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, counting him a malefactor in the higheſt degree, that departs without ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering, and fit to be carried before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to render an account of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacie; and delight to make men drink, till they vomit up their ſhame againe, like a filthy Dog; or lye wallowing in their beaſtlineſſe, like a brutiſh Swine; this is the moſt ſad and woefull ſpectacle that can be to a rectified underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>And whereas they <hi>brag</hi> of the <hi>conqueſt,</hi> when with the weapons of full charged cups, they have overcome the reſt; it is both the baſeſt office, and lamentableſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:23461:178"/>to themſelves, that can poſſibly be imagined. For what a barbarous, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and unchriſtian practiſe is this, to take pleaſure in making others drunke? as if it were their glory, and paſtime, and they tooke delight to ſee God diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, his Spirit grieved, his name blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his creatures abuſed, themſelves, and their friends ſoules damned; ſurely ſuch men clime the higheſt ſtep of the ladder of wickedneſſe; thinking their owne ſins will not preſſe them deepe enough into Hell, except they alſo lode themſelves with other mens.</p>
                     <p>And how ſottiſh is their opinion of <hi>victory,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they are moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome.</note> when even in <hi>conquering</hi> they are moſt <hi>overcome:</hi> for whilſt they triumph in a drunken <hi>victory</hi> or conqueſt over their <hi>friends,</hi> Sathan gets the <hi>victory</hi> over <hi>them:</hi> in exceſſive drinking they have <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome</hi> all their <hi>companions,</hi> this they ſee and boaſt of; but they ſee not how they are <hi>overcome,</hi> ſhamefully foyled, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly overthrown by the <hi>divell</hi> their chief enemy; under whoſe laſh they are like to be everlaſtingly.

                     <p>O how the <hi>paſſions</hi> of <hi>anger,</hi> and <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of <hi>love</hi> over-rules and over-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades our judgements! wee may truly ſay, that love, hatred, and indifferency, lookes through three paire of eyes: what we ſee, or heare, being paſſionately tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported either by love, or anger, wee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee, nor heare it as it is.

As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (indeed the Scriptures afford not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my examples of it, in them which were drunkards, for drunkenneſſe was then as rare, as now it is common, but what is true of all the Serpents ſeed, muſt needs be true of Sathans peculiar ones. How did <hi>anger</hi> rob <hi>Haman</hi> of his judgement, who thought <hi>Mordecae's</hi> not bowing the knee to him, a more heynous offence, then his owne murthering of thouſands? And <hi>Iezabel</hi> of hers, who thought it a greater ſinne in <hi>Eliah</hi> to kill <hi>Baals</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, then in her ſelfe to ſlay all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Lord? And the <hi>Phariſis</hi> of

And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Ahab,</hi> who thought <hi>Eliah</hi> troubled <hi>Iſrael</hi> more, in doing the wil of the Lord, then himſelfe, in provoking the Lord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which were before him? which is the caſe of our drunkards, they cenſure more deeply, our fearing of God, then their owne blaſpheming of him,; and thinke it a more heinous offence, for us to be ſober, then for themſelves to be drunke. What then are their cenſures of us, when wee do offend?</p>
                     <p>Yea, if mens paſſions and affections did not make them ſtrangely partiall; how could they ſuffer their faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter (who lies ledger for the great King of Heaven and Earth) to feed upon Cruſts, and ſpinne out twenty or

                     <p>In ſurveying their owne evill actions they are beetle eyed, or like him, <hi>Iohn</hi> the 9. who had never a ſeeing eye; or at leaſt like <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> who had onely one eye; but in ſpying ours, they have the eyes of a Baſiliske, and are as quick ſighted as <hi>Argos,</hi> who had his head compaſſed with an hundred eyes; yea, as <hi>Lynceus</hi> (who as <hi>Varro</hi> ſpeakes) could ſee through a wall; or if they have two ſeeing eyes, yet, like the purblind, they ſee double, or like thoſe women of <hi>Scythia</hi> called <hi>Bithiae,</hi> they have two ſights in each eye: for if they looke upon our actions, it is with an evill eye, judging of us by what wee ſhould bee; if upon their owne, it is with a tender eye, and ſo judge by what they are in their owne opinion, and the judgement of ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>And to mend the matter, Sathan, like our cunning men, preſents unto them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things in a falſe glaſſe, ſtamping his own image on Gods ſilver, and Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

                     <p>But our comfort is, they cannot do as they would, though their <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſhall bee <hi>never the leſse.</hi> For as the will to doe God acceptable ſervice, is accepted, as if it were ſervice indeed: ſo the intent and offer of <hi>wrong,</hi> ſhall be judged for wrong in that Court of Juſtice; good and evill <hi>thoughts</hi> and deſires, in Gods account, are good and evill workes; and hee which in good, accepts the will for the deed; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes</hi> the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi> in evill: now theſe men in their hearts, and Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, are murtherers, and for murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers they ſhall be arraigned at the great day of accounts; for they <hi>would kill</hi> us, if they <hi>durſt,</hi> they doe kill, ſo farre as they can.</p>
                     <p>It were no living for godly men, if their enemies <hi>hands</hi> were allowed to bee as <hi>bloody</hi> as their <hi>hearts;</hi> if they were not ſtinted by a divine and ſupreame power: but for our comfort as men and divels are under the reſtraint of the Almighty; ſo bleſſed bee God, and bleſſed bee our

                     <p>Alaſſe! if lewd men ſhould not feare the Magiſtrate, more then they feare God, or the Devill, there were no living among them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, how often are they curbed by a Divine hand? How often doe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells (thoſe miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth for the good of the Elect) reſiſt their Actions, even in thoſe ſinnes which their hearts ſtand to. It is no thanke to lewd men that their wickedneſſe is not proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: whence is it that the world is not over-runne with evill, but from this, that men cannot be ſo evill, as they would?</p>
                     <p>It is with theſe men, as it was with <hi>Zoilus,</hi> that common ſlanderer, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded why he ſpake evill of ſuch, and ſuch anſwered, <hi>becauſe I cannot do them evill,</hi> or elſe like another <hi>Pariſian</hi> Vigils, we ſhould feele their ſwords, before we heard their alarums.</p>
                     <p>Wicked men have <hi>courage</hi> above their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and their dareing is above their skill; they have <hi>courage</hi> to <hi>attempt</hi> much

The Maſter keepes the Maſtive chain'd up from hurting his friends, yet ſets him on the theife, if he ſee cauſe: ſo God doth by Sathan, it is not that Maſtives fault, that he tares not all in peeces; wherefore we may be glad we ſcape ſo as we doe, as a Iuſtice, upon the Bench, told a condemned perſon at the Barre, who ſued to him for mercy.</p>

                     <p>As for the Heathen Philoſophers, who knew not God in Chriſt, they are more righteous then wicked Chriſtians beyond compare, for they beleeved as Pagans, but lived as Chriſtians: wheras

                     <p>There be many profeſſed Chriſtians, but few imitaters of Chriſt: we have ſo much ſcience, and ſo little conſcience; ſo much knowledge, and ſo little practiſe; that to thinke of it, would move wonder to aſtoniſhment, had not our Lord told us, that, even amongſt thoſe that heare the Goſpell, three parts of the good ſeede falls upon bad ground.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, the holy Scriptures are, as it were, an Epiſtle ſent unto thee from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and written by God himſelfe, to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> and <hi>call</hi> thee to <hi>repentance:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt himſelfe no leſſe ſaith unto thee from Heaven, when thou art drinking, ſwearing, mocking, ſcoffing, deriding, enuying, hateing, oppoſing, and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any that beleeve in him, then once he
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:23461:253"/>did to <hi>Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? I am Ieſus whom thou perſecuteſt; it is hard for thee to kicke againſt the prickes:</hi> for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Spirit ſpeaketh generally, or ſpecially in the Word, is the voice of the whole Trinity, and intended particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thee, and to me, and to every man ſingle, his caſe being the ſame: What? doſt thou looke for <hi>Caine</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> to come out of Hell to warne thee? it is ſufficient their ſinne and puniſhment is written for thy learning.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all; for though he <hi>calls</hi> chiefely by his <hi>Word,</hi> yet he doth not call onely by it; for never any thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto thee in thy whole life, whether thou receiveſt benefits, or puniſhments; hearedſt threatnings, exhortations, or promiſes, from any his Embaſſadors of the Miniſtery, but all, whether faire meanes, or foule, have beene ſent from God, to <hi>invite</hi> and <hi>call</hi> thee to <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance; He even therefore threatens Hell,</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. Chryſoſtome) that he may not puniſh thee by the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All Gods bleſſings are like ſo many ſuters, <hi>woing</hi> thee to <hi>repentance;</hi> yea, they put on even the formes of Clyents, and

                        <hi>petition</hi> thee for <hi>repentance;</hi> his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Embaſſadors, ſent to treat with thee about a league, which cannot be had without repentance; all the creatures of God, ordained for thy uſe, are ſo many ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermons, ſo many trumpets, that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thee to <hi>repentance;</hi> in briefe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Spirit of grace knock at the dore of thine heart, with ſuch infinite checks, and holy motions, but that he would come in? and he will not come in, till repentance hath ſwept the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Why waſt thou not with thy harlot, like <hi>Zimry</hi> in the armes of <hi>Cozby,</hi> ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the act of thy Adultery? Why was not thy ſoule and hers, ſent coupled to the fire of torment, as your bodies were undevided in the flame of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? While thy mouth is opened to ſweare and blaſpheme, why is it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fild with fire and brimſtone? When thou art dead drunke, why art thou ſuffered to wake againe alive, but this, God waites (as in the Parable of the Fig tree, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.) another, and another yeare, to try whether thou wilt bring forth the fruit of repentance, and new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? yet preſume not; for as when
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:23461:254"/>men give long day, they expect larger payment; ſo does God, or for default thereof, conferres a heavier doome; the firſt fellony may ſcape, in hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the ſecond, much more the ſeventh, meetes with (as well it deſerves) a halter.</p>
                     <p>Yea, of this be ſure, if Gods long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering workes no reformation, this ſilent Judge will at laſt ſpeake home. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant ſuffers many injuries from the inferiour beaſts; but warre being too farre provoked, his revenge is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, then his patience was reiniſſe: and the higher the Axe is lifted up, the deeper it cuts.</p>
                     <p>But what doe I nominating particulars, when thou haſt had <hi>more warnings,</hi> and <hi>invitations,</hi> then thou haſt haires on thy head: Gods benefits offered thee in Chriſt (and they all ſolicit thee to repent) are without number, though thy ſinnes ſtrive with them, which ſhall be more. If thou couldeſt count the numberleſſe number of creatures, they would not be anſwerable, to the number of his gifts; though the number of thine offences, which thou returneſt in liew of them, are not much inferiour.</p>

                     <p>Not to enter into particulars, which were endleſſe, but to give you the ſumme or epitomy of them; for I had rather preſſe you with weight, then oppreſſe you with number of Arguments. The Lord Chriſt hath not onely ranſomed thee from infinite evills here, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments hereafter; but alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed every good thing thou doſt enjoy, whether for ſoule, or body, even to the very bread thou eateſt, and that with the price of his owne precious blood; and, as if all this were too little, he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for thee <hi>ſuch pleaſures at his right hand, as never entred into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> and to the end onely, that thou ſhouldeſt ſerve, and ſet forth the praiſe of his Name, who hath done all this.</p>
                     <p>As he deſcended into Hell, that we might never come thither; ſo he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, to prepare a place for us, which we have no right unto.</p>
                     <p>What ſhould I ſay? If we looke <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> we finde our Creator's <hi>mercies;</hi> if we looke <hi>upward,</hi> his <hi>mercy reacheth unto the Heavens;</hi> if <hi>downeward, the earth is full of his goodneſſe, and ſo is the broad Sea;</hi>
                        <pb n="483" facs="tcp:23461:255"/>if we looke <hi>about us,</hi> what is it that he hath not given us? Ayre, to breath in; Fire, to warme us; Water, to coole and cleanſe us; Cloathes, to cover us; Foode, to nouriſh us; Fruits, to refreſh us; yea, Delicates, to pleaſe us; Beaſts, to ſervous; Angells, to attend us; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to receive us; and, which is above all, his owne Sonne to redeeme us: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever we turne our eyes we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke beſides his bounty.</p>
                     <p>O conſider of theſe his mercies, you that forget God; and then, though there were no Hell, no puniſhment for ſinne, yet you would not tranſgreſſe. Haſt thou any braines, or heart to conceive what it is he hath beſtowed, what thou haſt received, what thou haſt deſerved? No ſurely, for if thou hadſt braines, and wert a wiſe man, it would make thee mad, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes in another ſenſe, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.7. or if thou hadſt a heart not like a ſtone, or an Adamant, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods love, and thy odious unthankefulneſſe, would make it ſplit and breake in peeces. But heare it againe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, thou wert <hi>created</hi> by <hi>him</hi> a man,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:23461:256"/>and not a beaſt: in <hi>England,</hi> not in <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia;</hi> in this cleare and bright time of the Goſpell, not in the darkeneſſe of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, or Popery.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, thou wert <hi>redeemed</hi> out of Hell by <hi>his</hi> precious <hi>blood;</hi> he ſpared not himſelfe, that his Father might ſpare thee. Oh thinke what flames the damned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, which thou mayſt eſcape, if thou wilt thy ſelfe; me thinkes this ſhould melt a heart of Adamant.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he hath <hi>preſerved</hi> thee here from manyfold dangers of body and ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he hath all thy life long plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and graciouſly <hi>bleſſed</hi> thee with many and manifold good things.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, promiſed thee not onely <hi>felicity</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> but in <hi>Heaven,</hi> if thou wilt ſerve him.</p>

                     <p>Though few men will confeſſe their ſinnes; yet many mens ſins will confeſſe their maſter.

But of theſe ſeveralls elſewhere, leaſt I ſhould overmuch ſeeme to digreſſe: only I grieve to ſee how they wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in thus wronging others: for in
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:23461:280"/>that wicked men doe ſo mock and deride ſuch as are in love with heavenly things, it is hard to ſay, whether they doe moſt offend, in hindering the honour of God thereby, or their neighbours wellfare, or their own ſalvation. What are the waters of thine own ſinns ſo low, that thou muſt have ſtreames from every place, to run into thine Ocean? thy owne burthen is unſupportable, yet thou wilt adde to the weight other mens, that thy riſing may be irrecoverable. Content thy ſelfe, for aſſuredly, thou ſhalt once pay deare for it, either by teares, or torment.</p>
                     <p>Yea, let ſuch take heed, for the fire of Hell will be hot enough for a mans owne iniquities; he needs not the iniquities of others, like fuell and Bellowes to blow, and increaſe the flame: which if they well conſidered, would make them cheriſh all good deſires in the weake, and to deale in this caſe, as we uſe when we carry a ſmal Light in the winde, hide it with our lap, or hand, that it may not go out. Oh how much eaſier is it to ſubvert, or caſt down a thing, then to erect it, when even a baſe fellow could deſtroy that Temple in one day, which was ſix and thirty yeares in ſeting up.</p>

                     <p>True it is,
<note place="margin">None but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeits wil be beaten from Chriſts ſtandard by their ſcoffes and reproaches.</note> if the barking of theſe Currs ſhall hinder us from walking on our way, it is a ſigne we are very impotent; yea, if our love be ſo cold to Chriſt, that we are aſhamed for his ſake to beare a few ſcoffs and reproaches from the world, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent we are but counterfeits: for, for our comforts, it ſhall not bee ſo with thoſe whom God hath any intereſt in, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſcoffes of Atheiſts and careleſſe worldlings, they ſhall not onely looſe their labours herein, but themſelves too. The faithfull will neither buy peace with diſhonour, nor take it up at intereſt of danger to enſue: wel may they ſerve as Snuffers, to qualifie our zeale, and make it burne brighter, but never become ſuch Extinguiſhers, as to put it quite out, either by perſecutions, or by perſwaſions. So that their ſpitefull adverſaries <hi>imagine but a vaine thing,</hi> they ſhall be no more able to <hi>hinder</hi> any one from <hi>ſalvation,</hi> whom God hath choſen to his Kingdome of grace and glory, then <hi>Saul</hi> with his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, could hinder <hi>David,</hi> from attaining the promiſed Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> they may move the godly, but not remove them; <hi>They have oftentimes afflicted me,

The League that Heaven hath made, Hell wants power to break: who can ſeparate the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Deity, <hi>Whom God did predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, them alſo hee called; and whom he called, them alſo he juſtified; and whom hee juſtified, them hee alſo glorified, Rom.</hi> 8.30. They ſhall ſooner blow up Hell with traines of Powder, then breake the chaine of this dependant truth. No power of man is able to withſtand the will of God, it ſhall ſtand firmer then the Firmament: it is as poſſible to ſtop the
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:23461:282"/>motion of the Sun, as the courſe of Gods predeſtination. A fire in the heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth all other fires without, as wee ſee in the Martyres, which when the ſweet doctrine of Chriſt had once gotten into their hearts, it could not bee got out again, by all the torments, which wit, and cruelty could deviſe: and the reaſon is, they over-looke theſe bug-bears, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt calling, the Spirit aſiſting, the Father bleſſing, the Angels comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Word directing, and the Crown inviting.</p>
                     <p>Alaſſe! if their ſcoffes, and all they can ſay, could flout us out of the integrity of our hearts, when our fore Fathers feared not the flames, we were feareful cowards. Indeed, the timorous Snaile puts out her hornes to feele for danger, and puls them in againe without cauſe. If the ſluggard heares of a Lion in the way, hee quakes; but tell it to a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> or a <hi>David,</hi> they wil go out to meet him: yea, let <hi>Aggabus</hi> tel <hi>Paul</hi> of bands at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he anſwers, <hi>I am ready not only to be bound, but to dye at Ieruſalem, for the name of Ieſus, Act.</hi> 21.13 The Horſe neighs at the Trumpet, the Leviathan laughs at the Speare: ſo tell the

                     </p>
                     <p>But what of all this? What though none of Chriſts owne band can be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. When thou doſt the utmoſt of thy power, and, ſo farre as in thee lyes, flout men out of their faithes, and ſlay them with death eternall? and when the <hi>intention,</hi> and offer of this miſchiefe, ſhall be <hi>judged,</hi> as if thou <hi>hadſt done</hi> the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe?

One man wills the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of anothers wife, he never attaines it, perhaps never attempts it; yet he is an Adulterer.

                     <p>For know this, that whoſoever Chriſt ſaveth with his blood, he ſanctifieth with his Spirit; and where his death takes away the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo effectuall for rhe mortifying of ſinne, <hi>Romans</hi> 6, 5, 6. <hi>Chriſts blood,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zanchie, was ſhed, as well for ablution, as for abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> as well to cleanſe from the foyle and
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:23461:295"/>filth of ſin, as to cleare and aſſoyle from the guilt of ſin. <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that wee ſhould be holy and without blame before him, in love, Eph.</hi> 1.4. they therefore that never come to be holy, were never choſen.</p>
                     <p>Hee is ſaid to have given himſelfe for us, that hee might redeeme us from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and <hi>purge us to bee a peculiar people unto himſelfe, zealous of good workes, Titus</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75.

                     <p>Secondly, the Lawes of our Land, wil not admit a delinquent for a witneſſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is found guilty; neither will I: and they ſtand convicted of folly, Sections the 34.38.39.40.51.91.157.184.190.

<pb n="615" facs="tcp:23461:321"/>to over-reach the Divell himſelfe: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he hath one trick beyond all theirs, for like a cunning fencer, hee that taught them al their tricks, kept this one to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, namely, how to cheat them of their ſoules.</p>
                     <p>But to go on. Theſe are not <hi>wiſe as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> according to our Saviours counſell, but wiſe Serpents, that is, wiſe in evill, not wiſe in that which is good; or, if you will, wiſe in goods, not wiſe in grace. For as that old Serpent ſeemed to boaſt, that he was richer then Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>all theſe are mine:</hi> ſo the politician may truly ſay, for the moſt part, I am wiſer then my plain dealing neighbour, by five hundred pounds, but ſee their wiſdome diſplayed.</p>
                     <p>They are ſuch cunning diſſemblers, that like Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, what they think, they never ſpeake: <hi>why is this caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?</hi> ſaith <hi>Iudas,</hi> crafty cub! he would have had it himſelf: as the Fox would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade other beaſts from that booty, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hee meanes to make his owne: or like a fellow that rides to the pillory, they go not the way they looke; they will cut a mans throat under colour of curteſie: as <hi>Vlyſses</hi> by gold and forged letters, was the means
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:23461:322"/>of ſtoning <hi>Palamedes,</hi> even while he made ſhew of defending him: and then, to wipe off all ſuſpicion from themſelves, their geſture and countenance ſhall be like <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caeſar's,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Pompie's</hi> head, fel a weeping, as if he had beene ſorry for it, when by his onely meanes it was cut off; ſo, like Rowers in a Boat, whilſt, in their pretence, they looke one way, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they go the quite contrary.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved of the Fox, that he will ſtand by the river and let his taile play in the water, till the Fiſh come flocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; and then with a jerke, he ſwoopes them out with his paw: theſe are ſuch Foxes, they will not looke towards the booty they ayme at; yea, they are ſo poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, that no man ſhall be able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, either by their geſture, vvords, or actions, vvhat they reſolve; for their vvords, like an <hi>Italian</hi> Torch, vvill prove your bane, vvhen they ſeeme to give you moſt light, and beſt direction; they vvill ſay, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> to the <hi>Syrian</hi> Army, <hi>follow me, and I will lead you to the man whom yee ſeeke,</hi> vvhen they lead you into the lap of your enemies, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.19. And ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this is their geſture and actions, for
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:23461:322"/>like <hi>Acco,</hi> they will evermore ſeeme to refuſe, what they moſt deſire; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, what they moſt deſpiſe.</p>
                     <p>Yea, they can hardly be read, though, like <hi>Hebrew</hi> letters, you ſpell them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: for admit the ſtander by conceives their going to be like that of a Crab-fiſh, contrary to the way they looke, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour knew it fared with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces, Mat.</hi> 16.1.3. which made him conclude with, <hi>O Hypocrites!</hi> yet having not the ſpirit of diſcerning, he can but gueſſe at it, and ſo give over; onely this he may be ſure of, that they doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, what they pretend; like as in jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling feates, though we know not how they are done, yet we know well, that they are not done, as they ſeeme to be.</p>
                     <p>Now if they can any way advantage themſelves by anothers ruine, and doe it cunningly, as <hi>Ieſabel</hi> did, when ſhe kild <hi>Naboth,</hi> by ſuborning falſe witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and proclaimed a Faſt, before the murther; though all ſuch policy, be but miſery; and all ſuch knowledge, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; yet, ô how wiſe they thinke themſelves, now they are able to blind the Devill with a Cuſhion: but they are
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:23461:323"/>groſſely miſtaken, for wherein doth this their great wiſdome conſiſt, but firſt, in being wiſe to deceive others, as the old Serpent did our firſt Parents; or, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the end to deceive themſelves, as the ſame Serpent did, which brought a curſe upon himſelfe for ſo doing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>The crafty Fox hug'd himſelfe, to thinke how he had coſened the Crow of her breakfaſt: but when he had eaten it, and found himſelfe poyſoned with it, he wiſh't the Crow her owne againe. Wealth got by deceit, is like a peece of buttered ſponge, (an <hi>Italian</hi> tricke) it goes downe glib, but in the ſtomack ſwells, and will never be got out againe. The gaines a man gets by deceiving, at laſt, he may put in his eye, and yet ſee himſelfe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Sinne is the greateſt cheater in the world, for it deceives the deceiver.</p>
                     <p>That it is ſo with them, and all others, who goe to counſell, and leave the God of wiſdome behind them, let their caſe be viewed in other perſons. What ſaith <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his deepe counſellers? <hi>Come, let us doe wiſely,</hi> when indeed he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which deſtroyed him, and his countrey. The Scribes, Phariſees, and
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:23461:323"/>Elders <hi>tooke counſell againſt Chriſt,</hi> as though they would moſt wiſely prevent their owne Salvation. <hi>Ioſeph's</hi> Brethren to prevent his having dominion over them, as his dreames imported, thought they had taken a very wiſe courſe, in ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to the <hi>Iſhmalitiſh</hi> Merchants, which was indeed the only meanes to effect it. See here in theſe three examples, you have the depth &amp; ſolidity of our great eſt and wiſeſt politicians; and yet lewd men, moſt abſurdly, and ridiculouſly, call wicked policies, wiſdome; and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, happineſſe; but herein Sathan makes them of all Fooles the ſuperlative, in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking villany and madneſſe, for the beſt vertues.</p>
                     <p>And what is the <hi>ſumma totalis</hi> of all, but this, <hi>Faux</hi>-like, they project other mens over-throw, purchaſe their owne: neither hath any man beene <hi>wiſe</hi> to <hi>doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> but his <hi>wiſdome</hi> hath had an <hi>evill end,</hi> as,</p>
                     <p>O the multitude of examples which are recorded, to give credit to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine! Was not the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent turned into a <hi>curſe?</hi> the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> into a <hi>woe?</hi> the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:23461:324"/>
                        <hi>Achitophel</hi> into <hi>folly?</hi> the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> into confuſion? the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of the unjuſt Steward into <hi>expulſion</hi> out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of <hi>Ieſabel</hi> into a <hi>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death?</hi> and ſhall not the deceivers <hi>wiſdome,</hi> the extortioners <hi>wiſdome,</hi> the ſorcerers <hi>wiſdome,</hi> the hypocrites <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> the matchevilians <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and the perſecutors <hi>wiſdome</hi> have their ſeverall ends anſwerable? yes undoubtedly; for in the iſſue, their caſe will be but like the Spiders, that was weaveing a curious net to catch the Swallow, who when ſhe came, bore away both net, and web, and weaver too. Wherefore O God make me but ſoule wiſe, and I ſhall never enuy their knowledge, that pity my ſimplicity: yea, let me be weake in policy, ſo I may be wiſe to ſalvation. But to make it more manifeſt, that they are ſtarke Fooles, come we to particulars, though I'le give you but one of ten, being loth to ſurfet my Reader.</p>

I am come into the world,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that whoſoever beleeveth in me, ſhould not ſit in darkneſſe, Iohn,</hi> 12.46. <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> are the two <hi>eyes</hi> of the ſoule. Reaſon diſcernes naturall objects, <hi>faith ſpirituall</hi> and ſupernaturall. We may ſee, farre with our bodily eye, ſenſe; farther, with the <hi>minds eye,</hi> reaſon; but farther, with the <hi>ſoules eye, Faith,</hi> then with both. Yea, the rationall doth not ſo farre exceede the ſenſuall, as the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exceeds the rationall: and though
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:23461:341"/>reaſon and humane learning, is as oyle to the Lampe of our underſtandings, which makes them burne clearer; yea, ſo <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the ſight of our minds,</hi> as <hi>Menander</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>that there is as much difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the learned and unlearned, as there is betweene man and beast:</hi> yet <hi>Faith</hi> and illumination of the ſpirit, adds to the <hi>ſight</hi> of our minds, as a Proſpective glaſſe adds to the corporall ſight, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17. Chriſt is the Sunne of the ſoule, <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> the two <hi>Eyes, I am the light of the world,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>he that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me,</hi> meaning, by a lively <hi>Faith, ſhall not walke in darkneſſe; but ſhall have the light of life, Iohn,</hi> 8.12. and more ſee two eyes then one. Yea, the day, with one eye, doth for more things deſcry, then night can doe with more then <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> eyes. Vnregenerate men who want faith, are like blind <hi>Sampſon,</hi> without his guide. So that we muſt have minds lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above nature, to ſee, and love things above nature; heavenly wiſdome, to ſee heavenly truth; or elſe that truth, which is ſaving, will be to us a myſtery, yea, ſeeme <hi>fooliſhneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 2.7, 8, 14. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>ſpirit reveales all things to the beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

                     <p>Wherefore get <hi>faith,</hi> and thou haſt mounted another ſtep to wiſdome, entred a third roome of this Palace.</p>

                        </note> he muſt be <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> in <hi>prayer</hi> to God, for the diriction of his holy Spirit, for,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, humble and faithfull <hi>prayer,</hi> uſhered in by meditation, is the cure of all obſcurity, eſpecially being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with fervor and <hi>fervency. If any lacke wiſdome,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. Iames, let him aske of God, which giveth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man, and it ſhall be given him, Iam.</hi> 1.5. marke the words: it is ſaid, <hi>if any:</hi> wherefore let no man deny his ſoule this comfort: againe, <hi>aske, and have,</hi> it cannot come upon eaſier termes: yea, God ſeemes to like this ſute ſo well in <hi>Solomon,</hi> as if he were beholding to his Creature for wiſhing good to it ſelfe, yea more, <hi>whatſoever we aske in prayer, if we beleeve, we ſhall have it, Math.</hi> 21.22. And in vaine doe we <hi>expect</hi> that <hi>Almes</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, as <hi>Sampſons</hi> companions could never have found out his Riddle, if they had not plowed with his heyfer: <hi>ſo no man can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. And as none can behold the light of the Sunne, but by the benefit of the Sunne: <hi>ſo none can know God</hi> (who is called the Father of lights, in the plurall number, becauſe of the degrees and diverſities of his gifts) <hi>nor the things of God, but by the revelation of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.17. with the Spirits helpe, the meanes can never be too weake; without, never ſtrong enough. One excellent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary prerogative of the ſpirituall man, is this, he hath God for his teacher, he learnes the counſells of God, of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which only knoweth God's counſells, <hi>Luke,</hi> 21.15. For though his outward man receives the elements and rudiments of Religion, by breeding and education; yet his inward man receiveth them by heavenly inſpiration. For as ſpirituall wiſdome is not the fruite of time and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the naturall is: ſo it hath a higher
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:23461:342"/>fountaine then nature to feede it, even the Spirit of God; which is no ſmall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for the Scholler learnes quickly, when the Holy Ghoſt is his teacher; the eye ſees diſtinctly, when the Holy Ghoſt doth enlighten it.</p>
                     <p>When Chriſt taught in the Temple, they askt, <hi>how knoweth this man the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſeeing he never learned them?</hi> ſo it is a wonder what learning ſome men have, that have no learning: like <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> poore Tent-makers, which were able to ſchole <hi>Apollos,</hi> that great Clarke, a man renowned for his learning. What can we ſay to it? for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given for it, but as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Father, ſo it pleaſeth thee.</hi> For as <hi>Iacob</hi> came ſo ſoone with his Veniſon, that his father askt him, how he came by it ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; and <hi>Iacob</hi> anſwered, <hi>becauſe the Lord thy God brought it ſuddenly to my hands:</hi> ſo holy and righteous men, can give no other reaſon, why they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words of God ſo eaſily, and the wicked doe conceive them ſo hardly, but that God brings the meaning ſuddenly to their hearts, as we reade, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. that Chriſt ſtanding in the midſt of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:23461:343"/>after he was riſen from the dead, <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their underſtandings, that they might underſtand clearely the Scriptures,</hi> and what vvas vvritten of him, in the lavv of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes verſ. 44.45.

                     <p>Wherefore importune God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the direction of his holy Spirit, and thou ſhalt, at the leaſt, have <hi>light</hi> enough on <hi>earth,</hi> to bring thee to the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in <hi>praying</hi> for <hi>wiſdome,</hi> obſerve one caution,
<note place="margin">But pray not for knowledge without putting difference</note> doe not <hi>pray</hi> for it, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>difference.</hi> There is a ſpeculative knowledge in the braine, common to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, with Gods children; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. and there is an experimentall and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge in the heart, peculiar to the godly alone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. and 5.8. <hi>pray</hi> eſpecially for the laſt of theſe, let thine hearts deſire be, to know God in Chriſt; Chriſt, in faith; faith, in good workes; to know Gods will, that thou mayſt doe it; and before the knowledge of all other
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:23461:343"/>things, deſire to know thy ſelfe; and in thy ſelfe, not ſo much thy ſtrength, as thy weakeneſſe: pray that thine heart may be inſteed of a Commentary, to helpe thee underſtand ſuch points of religion as are moſt needfull and neceſſary, and that thy life may be an expoſition of thy inward man, that there may be a ſweete harmony betwixt Gods truth, thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whole converſation; that what the naturall man knowes by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou mayſt double by feeling the ſame in thine heart and affections: as indeed, experimentall and ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is no leſſe felt, then knowne; and I cannot tell how, comes rather out of the abundance of the heart, then by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſtudy, or rather is ſent by God unto good men; like the Ramme that was brought to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he would have ſacrificed his Sonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi>

And what if the height had anſwered their deſire?

                     <p>Alas! even the wicked, for the moſt part, have their deſire; yea, more then their hearts can wiſh, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.7.9. but what's the iſſue? they ſet their mouthes againſt Heaven, like an unruly jade, that being full fed, kickes at his maſter; yea, how often doth wiſdome without grace, prove like a faire eſtate in the hands of a foole, which not ſeldome becomes the ovvners ruine; or like <hi>Abſolom's</hi> haire, which

                     <p>Now if thou wilt truly profit by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, reſolve to make them the <hi>rule</hi> of thy life. What is the reaſon many are converſant in thoſe divine and

                        </note> as worldly men do, touching their temporall poſſeſſions: goe to <hi>counſell,</hi> take <hi>adviſe</hi> of the Learned, (I meane the Miniſters) when hee is in any doubt: as who knowes the ſpots of his owne face, but either by the reflection of a glaſſe, or by the relation of others? and in a worke of great conſequence, it argues the candor and modeſty of a man, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a coadjutor.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>the Priests lippes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Malachi, preſerve knowledge; and the people ſeek the Law at his mouth, for hee is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, Mal.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                     <pb n="669" facs="tcp:23461:348"/>
                     <p>Yea, there is uſe to bee made of our friends, private Chriſtians, we ought to borrow our friends eyes; and lend them ours; for that we do not more love our ſelves above others; then we ſee others better then our ſelves; we can more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſee a moate in anothers eye, then a beame in our owne, Matth.</hi> 7.3,</p>
                     <p>It is not amiſſe ſometimes to goe from home, to heare what newes there is at home: as <hi>Tarlton</hi> told the Queene, hee was going to <hi>London,</hi> to heare what newes at Court: ſo a wiſe man will gather much knowledge of himſelf, from others obſervation; lookers on many times ſee more, then the actors doe. <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid, hee <hi>could better heare the newes of</hi> Rome <hi>at</hi> Antium, <hi>then at</hi> Rome <hi>it ſelfe;</hi> neither can <hi>Paris</hi> tell more newes of <hi>France;</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dril</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> then our Exchange in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> of both. Yea, what Traveller is able to ſpeake ſo much of forraigne parts, as hee that lookes no further then his ſtudie.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, every man in his owne cauſe is a party, and therefore partiall; ſo that hee which learnes of none but himſelfe, hath a foole to his teacher: yea, <hi>Salomon,</hi> no leſſe then nine times, brands him for a
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:23461:349"/>foole, who refuſeth admonition.</p>
                     <p>But herein obſerve one caution: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>adviſe,</hi> nor <hi>conſult</hi> with brutiſh ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualiſts; for their knowledge is ignorance; their wiſdome, folly; their ſight, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they neither conſider what reaſon ſpeaketh, or religion command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but what the will and appetite affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth: for will is the axeltree, luſts and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the wheeles, whereupon all their actions are carried, and doe runne; appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite being their lord, reaſon the ſervant, and religion their ſlave; whereas religion ſhould govern their judgments, judgment and reaſon their wils, and affections, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſhould have done <hi>Eve,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are the ſix ſteps which lead up to the palace of wiſdome; anſwerable to thoſe ſix ſteps which led up to <hi>Salomons</hi> Throne; which all muſt aſcend by, that meane to enter: the more of them you have aſcended, the nearer you are to heaven,</p>
                     <p>If you have once attained this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace of <hi>ſaving knowledge,</hi> you will (as much as in you lies) <hi>imploy</hi> the <hi>ſame,</hi> to the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>giver.</hi> There be ſome that care, not to know; and there be ſome,
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:23461:349"/>that care for nothing elſe but to know; many ſtrive after, and pray for knowledg, but why? they would be wiſer, not holier by it: it is their <hi>owne honour</hi> they ſeek, not the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> if they may bee thought great <hi>Rabbies,</hi> deep and profound Schollers, this is the height of their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though neither the Church be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, nor God glorified by it, whereas they ought the contrary. For, as the <hi>grace</hi> of God is the <hi>fountaine</hi> from which our <hi>wiſdom</hi> flowes, ſo the <hi>glory</hi> of God ſhould be the Ocean to which it ſhould runne: it is derived from the one, and muſt bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the other. Yea, that <hi>God</hi> may be <hi>honoured</hi> by our <hi>wiſdome,</hi> is the onely end for which he gives us to be wiſe; and for default of this end, he not ſeldome curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the meanes, whereby many ſtriving to expell ignorance, fall into error; as an Empirick to cure one diſeaſe; cauſeth a worſe.</p>
                     <p>If you would know in ſpeciall, whom they are, that in uſing their gifts, ſeek not the glory of God; you may diſcern them by theſe marks. Firſt, they will have al the talk, whereſoever they come, like Parrats. 2. They contemne others, like the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</hi>
                        <pb n="672" facs="tcp:23461:350"/>3. They will be wiſer then God, and not ſubmit their judgements and opinions to his word, like the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Pontifician Doctors, who becauſe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thwarts their opinions, and ſtands plainly forbidding images; that images may ſtand, they forbid the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4. They ſpurne at him which tells them of their faults, like <hi>Abner.</hi> 5. They jump with their ſuperiours in every thing, like the <hi>Herodians.</hi> 6. They turn with the time, like <hi>Demas.</hi> 7. They ſeek their own credit, by the diſcredit of others, like the enemies of <hi>Paul.</hi> 8. They love to heare their own praiſe, like <hi>Herod.</hi> 9. Above all, they would have their owne wills, like <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel;</hi> let theſe men denie it if they can. Yea, I would faine know what fruit, or effect theſe mens knowledge hath in them, except it bee to enable them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and diſcourſe, to increaſe wit, or to increaſe wealth, or to increaſe pride? whether the utmoſt of their ayme be not to enrich, dignifie, and pleaſe themſelves; not once caſting the eye of their ſoules at <hi>Gods glory,</hi> or their neighbours good? as let any fluent <hi>Herod,</hi> or eloquent <hi>Turtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> tell me, whether his knowledge puffs
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:23461:350"/>him not up, as if he had eaten a Spider; and whether he ſeekes not more the praiſe of his wit, then the profit of his ſoule, and feares not more an affront from his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, then he feares hell.</p>
                     <p>Againe, let any ſtrong brain'd <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> tell me, whether hee had not rather ſeeme wicked, then ſimple? Any unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, or Lawyer, whether his whole ayme bee not the purchaſing of land, without either feare of God, regard of men, or the diſcharge of his duty and office.</p>
                     <p>Briefly, ſo many as are puft up with their knowledge, or doe not part with their ſinnes, ſhew, that they never ſought it for <hi>Gods glory,</hi> but for their own honour and glory; and certainly, if we ſeeke not <hi>Gods glory,</hi> in doing his worke; hee will give us no wages, at the latter end.</p>
                     <p>But to apply what hath beene ſpoken.

<pb n="674" facs="tcp:23461:351"/>world thinks</hi> (like a childs bubble blowne into the aire) is fallen to the ground, and diſſolved to nothing. Alaſſe! the world is no more fit to judge of caſes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then a blind man is fit to judge of colours. Wherefore as the Orator would admit none but Rhetoricians, to judge of his Orations: ſo henceforward, admit none but ſpirituall men to ſway thee in ſpiritual matters, and follow our Saviours counſell, ſeeke to juſtifie thy judgement and practiſe to the children of wiſdome, of whom wiſdome is juſtified; and not to fooles, by whom ſhee is daily crucified. Only condole theſe blind mens diſaſters, and drop ſome teares in pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for their great and greivous miſery. And ſo much for the objection.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore if thou meaneſt to fare bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, make not Chriſt a <hi>bolſter</hi> for <hi>ſinne,</hi> leaſt the plaiſter prove worſe then the ſore; nor <hi>Gods mercy</hi> a warrant for thy <hi>continuing</hi> in an evill courſe; for this is to ſin with an high hand, or with a witneſſe (as we uſe to ſay) which if thou doeſt, thou ſhalt alſo periſh with a witneſſe, <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> 29.19, 20, 21.

                     <p>Secondly, though theſe ſparks of grace may kindle piety in others, yet not in thee: for what is light, to him that will ſhut his eyes againſt it?

As for example. Let us tell one, whom they have converſt withall, how ſweet a religious life is, and how farre the light of God's countenance, the peace of conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; doth ſurpaſſe all earthly felicity; he will not believe there

But they are ill diſcoverers, that think there is no land, when they can ſee nothing but Sea. Yea, viewing the godly but with natures eye, they thinke both God and nature envies them of all others, and that moſt men are deluded with a poyſonous lye, in making only the vertuous happy.</p>

                     <p>It is more true of vertue and God's truth, then it was of that <hi>Creetiſh</hi> beauty, <hi>no man loved her, that never ſaw her; no man ever ſaw her, but he loved her:</hi> neither could concupiſcence bring forth ſinne, without the conſent of Reaſon; and this would never conſent, ſo long as the eyes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.

<pb n="783" facs="tcp:23461:408"/>but a ſeparation was made betweene the ſick and the whole; and this <hi>ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> had no other intent, but <hi>edification;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an edification of the ſpirit, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fleſh: ſo that men could find no fault with the diſpenſers of this power, having nothing to complaine of, but that their lives thereby were ſought to be <hi>amended,</hi> and their <hi>ſoules</hi> to be <hi>ſaved.</hi> I confeſſe, that was a <hi>ſeparation</hi> of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nature, the power of the keyes being added, they were <hi>delivered up to Sathan,</hi> ſhut out of heaven; herein it is not ſo, but this ſerves to the ſame end, and is done only in caſes of like fact.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe was weighty, for which the gates of heaven, were to be locked; great, in the thing done; or great, in the wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the doer; and this not without reaſon: for the doome was heavie, and fit for the back of a ſtrong and mighty evil: it was a ſhort damnation, a temporall hell, a ſhutting out of heaven upon earth, yea, heaven in heaven, even the joyes, and comforts of the ſpirit of conſolation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it be but an excellent remedy, for, beſides that it was Gods inſtitution, the remedy was fitted to the diſeaſe: a
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:23461:409"/>degree of preſumption, was encountered with a degree of deſpaire; the Scorpion was made a medicine, againſt the ſting of the Scorpion; Sathan was ſet on worke, to take him downe by terror unto ſalvation; whom before hee animated and puffed up to deſtruction; he, that ſaid at firſt, ſin boldly, for <hi>ye ſhall not dye at all;</hi> now hee changeth his voyce, and ſaith, <hi>thy ſinne is greater then can be forgiven thee.</hi> But the wiſdom of diſpenſation ſuffered this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion no longer to terrifie, but untill his terror did mollifie: hee aimed indeed at deſpaire and deſtruction; but the Church aimed at humiliation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, yea, at conſolation and ſalvation. And indeed <hi>humiliation</hi> for ſinne, is the only way to <hi>converſion</hi> from ſinne; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> from ſin, the only way to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations</hi> of the Spirit; and the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit is both the guide and the way to life eternall: therefore, when the man is humbled, Sathan is caſheired; the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leech is taken away, when he hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently abated the vicious and ſuperfluous blood.</p>
                     <p>Thus were men <hi>healed,</hi> by <hi>wounding; exalted</hi> by <hi>humbling:</hi> O admirable uſe and
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:23461:409"/>command of Sathan! hee is an enemy to God, and yet doth him ſervice; he is an adverſary to man, and yet helpes him. A ſtrange thing, that Sathan ſhould help the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> to the <hi>destruction</hi> of his fleſh, his concupiſcence, and the <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of his ſoule. A ſtrange thing that Sathan ſhould teach <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> not to blaſpheme: he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of blaſphemies, and yet he teacheth not to blaſpheme.</p>
                     <p>But is Sathan contrary to himſelfe, and is his kingdome divided in it ſelfe? no ſurely: dut one that is ſtronger then hee both in wiſdome and power, manageth both his craft and malice, to ends, which himſelfe intendeth not. The divell is one and the ſame ſtill, even purely malicious; but God ſuffers him to go on in his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, juſt ſo farre as temptation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and no further: therefore while Sathan is driving the offender to deſpaire, God ſtops his courſe, when the ſinner is come to due humiliation: and then, as it was with <hi>Christ</hi> in the wilderneſſe, ſo is it with the humbled ſinner, Sathan is diſmiſſed, and the Angels come and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto him.</p>
                     <pb n="786" facs="tcp:23461:410"/>
                     <p>This was the nature, manner, and end of publike excommunication: private hath relation to it; both touching cauſe and end. Firſt, publike had reſpect to the cauſe; that it was to be uſed, only in caſe of ſcandalous, open, and notorious impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: ſo hath the private; wee do not breake off ſociety with any for weakneſſes, and ſinnes of infirmity. Secondly, that did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aime at their amendment, converſion, and ſalvation: ſo doth this; we deſire only to have them <hi>looke</hi> into themſelves, where the <hi>fault</hi> lyes, and ſeeke to <hi>amend</hi> their courſe: and certainly nothing will ſooner make the adultereſſe or drunkard bethink themſelves, then when they ſee, all that are honeſt and ſober, even their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and old aſſociates, ſhun their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and deſpiſe them, as if they were not worthy of humane ſociety: and if they have the leaſt deſire to be reputed honeſt and ſober againe, and admitted their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar converſe, (without which, they are, as it were, baniſhed into exile) they will do what poſſibly lyes in them to redeeme their credit, and merit their good opinion, by a more fober, honeſt, and holy demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: the diſparity lyeth only in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:23461:410" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſeverity of the agents; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, we doe not, we deſire not to deliver them up to Sathan; but heartily pray that they may bee delivered from him, and all evill.</p>

                     <p>The firſt thing that God did, after hee created Heaven and Earth, was, to <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> light from darkneſſe; probably to ſhew, that the <hi>good</hi> ſhould firſt of all <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from the <hi>evill,</hi> if they meane not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to become evill.

                     <pb n="789" facs="tcp:23461:411"/>
                     <p>There is a pliable diſpoſition in all men naturally to evill; we follow it, as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron doth the Loadſtone, by a naturall and hidden propenſity: our corrupt nature is like fire, which, if there be any infection in the roome, drawes it ſtreight to it ſelf: or like Jet, which omits all precious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and attracts nothing but ſtraws and duſt: or, if a man hath both good and bad in his nature, either of them will fortifie, as they meet with their like; or decline, as they finde a contrary: as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did in his ſtrength, who, at firſt being hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all the Princes of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> at laſt, by keeping <hi>Dalilah</hi> company, they ſet a boy to lead him.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſuppoſe a man ſtands indifferent; his <hi>company,</hi> whether good or evill, will work him into a new nature; and by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he ſhall grow up to the ſame height with them, as the Hop groweth to the end of the pole, be it never ſo high, and he himſelfe ſhall do the like to others; as one peece of Iron, being rub'd with the Loadſtone, will draw another peece, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as if it were the Loadſtone it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>A good man in ill <hi>company</hi> is like a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearle, fallen into the mud; vvhich
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:23461:412"/>the longer it lies, the deeper ſtill it ſinkes into it: for, if the force of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> ſimple and ſeparate be great; the force of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> copulate, and conjoyned, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate, is farre greater; for their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teacheth, company comforteth, emulation quickneth, glory raiſeth: ſo as in ſuch places the force of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> is in her exaltation: which made the mother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the twenty ſixth Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo carefull of her ſonnes educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe kept continually a guard of men to take heed, that no vicious perſons came unto him, to corrupt him in evill.</p>
                     <p>It was a good conceit of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and not triviall, when he ſet up a bill of an houſe, which he had to let, that he added, aye, and <hi>there be good neighbours too:</hi> for it ſhall go hard, but neighbourhood will ſomewhat mould the whole familie into better or worſe, as themſelves are. The ſore eye, we know, infecteth the ſound: and they that ſleep with dogs, ſhal ſwarm with fleaes: yea, a mans poſterity after him, ſhall gaine, or looſe by the bargaine. It were happy, if the injury of a wicked man could bee confined to his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; that he only might fare the worſe
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:23461:412"/>for his ſinnes; that it were but <hi>ſelfe do, ſelf have:</hi> but as his lewdneſſe, like ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſent, is diffuſed through the whole roome, or place where he is, and reacheth to the times, upon which he is unhappily falne: ſo after generations are the worſe by meanes of him. An ill preſident, is like <hi>Goodwin</hi> Sands, which not only ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his patrimony, but ſtill continues a dangerous place, where too many have miſcaried. Hee is a very meane perſon, that drawes not ſome Clyents after him: even <hi>Thewdas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> had their foure hundreds to accompany them. One man may kindle ſuch a fire, as thouſands are not able to quench: one plague-ſore may infect a whole nation: and all the venime of ſin is not ſpent in the act.</p>
                     <p>Sinne among men, like the Murraine in Cattell, or ſcab among Sheepe, is of a catching and <hi>infectious</hi> quality: and, like the Plague or Leproſie, will runne along from one to another: our corrupt nature is like tinder, which is kindled with the leaſt ſparke: wherefore it behoves us to avoid all provoking objects: as a man that hath Gunpowder in his houſe, keepes it ſafe from fire: and well were it for us, if
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:23461:413"/>lewd ones were forced to cry, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in <hi>Iſrael, I am uncleane, I am uncleane.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every thing labours to make the thing it meets with like it ſelfe; fire, converts all to fire; aire, exiccates and drawes to it ſelfe; water, moiſtens and reſolveth what it meetes withall; earth, changeth all that we commit to it to her owne nature. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will bee buſie in diſpending that quality which is predominant in him: we can converſe with nothing, but will work upon us, and by the unperceived ſtealth of time, aſſimilate us to it ſelfe: one rotten Aple will infect a whole floore: one pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid grape corrupts the whole ſound clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The <hi>choice</hi> therfore of a mans <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> is one of the moſt weighty actions of our lives; for our future well or ill being depends on that election: if we chooſe ill, every day inclines us to worſe, we have a perpetuall weight hanging on us, that is euer ſinking us downe to vice</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> wondred at thoſe which were curious in buying but an earthen diſh, to ſee that it had no cracks, nor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and yet would be careleſſe in the <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>friends,</hi> and take them vvith the flavves of vice. What was the reaſon
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:23461:413"/>(thinke we) that our Saviour vvould not ſuffer his vveake Diſciple, in the Goſpell, to go and bury his dead father? <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.60 It vvas not any averſeneſſe to civill, much leſſe filiall reſpect and duty to Parents; yea, he <hi>preferred mercy</hi> before <hi>ſacrifice;</hi> but he vvell knevv, that vvhen hee once met vvith his carnall friends at the funerall, they vvould pervert him againe, and quickly flout him out of his nevv Maſters ſervice, and that the Goſpell ſhould ſoone looſe a Preacher of him. The reaſon why the Raven returned not into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, as the Dove did, is given by ſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it met vvith a dead carkaſe by the vvay.</p>
                     <p>A vviſe man vvill bee vvarie, not only to <hi>ſhunne</hi> ſinne in the <hi>action,</hi> but in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>occaſion.</hi> Hovv many, that meant not to ſinne, are vvonn only by the opportunity? for <hi>occaſion</hi> and our <hi>nature</hi> are like tvvo inordinate lovers, they ſeldome meet, but they ſinne together, and every act of ſin, tyes a nevv knot: if vve keepe them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the harme is prevented: and it is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deny a gueſt at firſt, then to turn him out, having ſtayed a while: it is eaſier to keepe fire from flax, then to quench it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:23461:414"/>it is on fire: a man may ſpit out a ſpark, but when once kindled, there is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny quenching of it. Why do we pray, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from evill,</hi> but that we imply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other miſchiefes, that there is an <hi>infectious</hi> power in it, to make us evill? Let us therefore <hi>do</hi> what we <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> that we may <hi>doe</hi> it: yea, O Lord, free us both from ſpeech and ſight of theſe bauds and panders of vice, ſo farre as is poſſible; if not, at leaſt from joyning in league, or dwelling in houſe with, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dependency on ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Oh how many are there, that, like the Pine-tree, with their very ſhadow, hinder all other plants from growing under them: or, like the great mountaine Radiſh, which, if it bee planted neere the Vine, cauſeth it to ſtarve and wither away? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe! it is nothing to bee godly in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> houſe: but for a man <hi>to dwell in the tents of Kedar,</hi> or to live in the Court of <hi>Sardanapalus;</hi> and yet to keepe himſelfe upright, is a matter of great difficulty, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, for him that is not well rooted by time and experience. A fore new skind will fret off again, with the leaſt rubbing; yea, the very ſight of evill is dangerous,
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:23461:414"/>to ſuch an one; luſting, for the moſt part, followes looking; as wee ſee in <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3.6. and <hi>David</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2, 3. which makes <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaking of a ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, adviſe us to keepe farre from her, and not once come neere the doore of her houſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8. It is a hard matter for that ſoule, not to fall into thoſe vices, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the eyes and the eares are enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not out of love, but cuſtome, we fall into ſome offences.</p>
                     <p>We read that <hi>Perſina,</hi> that <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Queene, in <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> by ſeeing a faire picture of <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> was brought to bed of a faire white child; whereas Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, by ſeeing of a Beare, was brought to bed of a Monſter. I am ſure this is true in the morall of it; which ſhould make us equally love good company, and hate evill. I know there be in every place whole troops of evill perſons; and where there are many pots boyling, there cannot but be much ſcumme: ſo that a man ſhall finde it, either impoſſible, or hard, never to be amongſt them, or ſhift off their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations. Wherefore if at any time (as no flie is more importunate) they thruſt
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:23461:415"/>themſelves into thy converſation, doe as thoſe which muſt neceſſarily paſſe by a carrion in the way; hold thy breath, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in a multitude, abhorre to participate with them in their vices, and haſten to be out of their aire, as <hi>Peter</hi> did out of the high Prieſts hall, ſo ſoone as <hi>Chriſt</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him: and if they yet follow thee, turne back to them, with the Angels fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, <hi>increpet te Dominus.</hi> And laſtly, if by chance, with <hi>Peter,</hi> thou haſt taken the leaſt ſoyle, or infection from theſe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and pitchy Links, be ſure to ſcrape or bruſh it off thy ſoule againe, by prayer, examination, and humiliation: as they that come out of infected houſes, aire, or waſh their garments, for the more ſafety.

If a man will put him ſelfe among <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> he cannot promiſe to come forth inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; or if he doe, that ſoule which lives among thornes, ſhall hardly thrive in Grace. How many have fallen into a faſhion of ſwearing, ſcoffing, drinking, out of the uſuall practiſe of others: as thoſe that live in an ill ayre, are infected with diſeaſes? A man may paſſe through <hi>Ethiopia</hi> unchanged, but he cannot dwell there, and not be diſcoloured. When once a man gives himſelfe over to be the companion of vice, in the end he becomes the very ſlave of vice. The Oxe being tyed to the Figg-tree, looſeth his ſtrength. Many ſtrokes overthrow the ſtrongeſt Oke. Many drops of raine, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſoft, pierce the hardeſt Marble, yea, even the flint ſtone. And let graces be never ſo well fixt in a mans heart, yet he may ſoone have them conſumed and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

And little doe our peremptory reſolvers in this caſe know, or conſider, either the inſinuative power of evill, or the treachery of their owne hearts, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, or the importunity of wicked deceivers, in obtruding it: they are the worſe for their ſociety, and perceive it not.</p>
                     <p>An Egg covered with ſalt (as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers teach) hath the meate of it conſumed, whilſt the ſhell is whole. And we reade of many Townes, which have in time beene undermined, even with the moſt impotent and weake Creatures, as one in <hi>Spaine</hi> with Coneyes; in <hi>Theſſalia</hi> with Moles; in <hi>France</hi> with Frogs; in <hi>Africa</hi> with Flies.</p>
                     <p>Many an one receives poyſon, and knowes not when he tooke it. Many breath in this world, like men ſleeping in a boate, are caried downe the ſtreame, even to their graveſend, without waking, to thinke where they are.</p>
                     <p>No man proves extreamly evill on the ſudden: through many inſenſible decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:23461:417"/>doe we fall from vertue. Sathan's agents are ſtill ſcattering his firy darts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Army of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and when they light upon wood, they kindle; when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on flax, they flame; when upon gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, they blow up all. They therefore that love ſuch intricate and perplexed walkes, had need of Iron ſhoes.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that <hi>Christ</hi> converſed and kept <hi>company</hi> with <hi>Publicans</hi> and ſinners, (as the Phyſitian with the ſicke) to heale their ſoules: neither did they make him <hi>worſe,</hi> but he made them <hi>better:</hi> but as true it is, that he was without the levell of temptation; and ſo is no generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. I will therefore not only <hi>ſhun evill,</hi> but the <hi>meanes</hi> to come to it; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void hurt, I will keepe my ſelfe out of ſhot: neither will I preſume, being but a man, to follow my maſter in that which he did as God. Indeed, many are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous of their ſtrength, that they thinke they can come in any company, and yet come off cleare: but he which comes to ſave one drowning, muſt be ſtronger then the other, or elſe he will be drowned himſelfe.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, whereas they object: that we may <hi>gaine</hi> by their <hi>company:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it poſſble, for even the moſt veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and ravenous things that are, have their commodities, as well as their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances: And the Cocke by ſcraping in a dunghill, did once finde a Iewell: <hi>Virgil</hi> from <hi>Enniu's</hi> dunge did Gold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: and Apothecaries of Vipers fleſh can make an Antidote againſt poyſon: an Harlots face may ſuggeſt chaſtneſſe: and a ſinfull ſurfet may prove an Antidote for ſinne: yea, as externall cold kindles the heate of the ſtomacke: ſo we finde it recorded in holy Writ, that ſome, by a ſpirituall <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> have growne hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their zeale, by being encompaſſed with the outward cold of wicked and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious company: like Roſes and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which flouriſh the more for being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet

Thus it fared with <hi>Lot,</hi> who ſerved God better among the beaſtly <hi>Sodomites,</hi> then when he was ſeparated from them. And ſome others there are no doubt, who, as they owe not this grace to themſelves, ſo they are more for wonder, then imitation. For if <hi>Daniel</hi> found a guard in the Lyons Den, ſhall another thruſt himſelfe thereinto for ſhelter? and if <hi>Peter</hi> walkt upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the water, did the reſt of the Diſciples ſtep forth and follow him?

                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſay ſome. By keeping them <hi>company</hi> we may <hi>winne</hi> them, and happily <hi>convert</hi> their ſoules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer. Hope not ſo much to <hi>convert</hi> them; as feare that they will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> thee: for vertue is not ſo alluring as vice: the one ſpreads it ſelfe, like poyſon in a veſſell; the other is not halfe ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſive. Sinne, and <hi>Hagar,</hi> are more fruitfull then vertue and <hi>Sarah:</hi> falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, more ſucceſſefull then truth. The
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:23461:419"/>ſore eye infecteth the ſound: the ſound will not mend the ſore. Vinegar will mar wine; wine will not mend vinegar, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is ſpreading and catching: health is not ſo. An hundred ſound per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall ſooner catch the plague, from one infected perſon; then he receive his health from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salomon</hi> that wonder of wiſdome, might thinke by joyning in affinity with his neighbour Princes, and marrying their Daughters, to winne thoſe Heathens to the Kingdome of God: but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for he could doe no good upon them; they wrought him too much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. And doth not experience teach us, that the good are ſooner perverted by the bad, then the bad converted by the good? even as a tainted ayre doth more eaſily infect a ſound body, then an wholeſome can cleare the ſicke.</p>
                     <p>We reade of certaine Magneticall, or Adamantine Rockes, in the Iles of <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ole,</hi> which draw all ſhips unto them, that have any Iron pinnes, holding them ſo faſt, that they are not able to ſtirre: evill ſociety, are ſuch Rockes; holy men, the ſhips; naturall and inbred corruption,
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:23461:419"/>the Iron pinnes: he that will be ſafe, let him keepe farre enough from ſuch Rocks.</p>
                     <p>A good man, joyned in league with one that is wicked; is like a living man, bound to a dead corps, which will ſooner ſuffocate him, then he revive that: or, like an Iſickle, can endure the rough nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne wind of perſecution well enough, but melteth with the heate of the Sunne, ſweete allurements of the world, and the fleſh. The children of God are, as it were, dead to their luſts; but if they ſhould tempt God, by a too familiar ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with the vicious; who knowes, but as live coles will kindle dead ones; ſo their evill ſpeeches and actions may kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and enflame them with the love and liking of lewdneſſe? Indeed, as one ſaid to his ſuppliant, <hi>make me a Diviner, and I will make thee rich:</hi> ſo may a good man ſay to a vicious; make me Angelicall, that is, incapable of being ſeduced, and I'le doe my beſt to make thee a Convert.</p>

The ſtate of grace is heaven upon earth; and he that knowes the ſweetneſſe of Gods preſence, wil deeme it more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to bee ever alone, then never able to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>When I read of <hi>Hiero</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> and other ſuch, that gave over their Kingdomes, to live a ſolitary life, I ſomewhat wonder: I ſhould not, to heare of a religious and Chriſtian King that did ſo. It is impoſſible for the naturall man to be ſo merry, in company; as the believer alone; yea, ſaith S. <hi>Augustine, the teares of thoſe that pray, are ſweeter then the joyes of
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:23461:423"/>the Theater.</hi> Indeed, a witty jeſt may make a man laugh more, and lowder: but he who hath an inheritance fallen to him, feeles a more ſolid joy within: ſo hee that enjoyes his Saviour, and hath the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heaven, is truly merry at the heart, and keepes <hi>Hilary Tearme</hi> all his life. And indeed, nothing in the world is worth envie, beſides the condition of a true Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But to what end doe I tell a blind man, how glorious and bright a creature the Sunne is? or a poore man, what ſummes of money are in the Kings Exchequers? To ſo many as are unrenewed I ſpeake in Parables, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.17. Yea, this ſeemes to them a <hi>Paradox,</hi> that the people of God ſhould be a merry people: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, they dreame of nothing but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe, and melancholly: as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people thought <hi>Tully</hi> to bee moſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, when he ſtudied moſt: or as the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman in <hi>Aeſope</hi> objected idleneſſe to the Poet: but as he replyed, <hi>I am never ſo idle as in thy company:</hi> ſo may the religious, we are never ſo ſolitary, never ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly; as when in ſociety with you that are vicious.

                     <p>And a double reaſon may be given of it, though we feare not to ſuffer either in our perſons, goods, or good names (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have it.) For firſt, the ſoule that lives among thornes, ſhall hardly thrive, they are ſuch Backbyaſſes to a godly life, that they will do what they can, to hinder our goodneſſe to heaven, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heaven to us; they will wither all our good parts and qualities which are in us; like an evill North-wind, they blow upon the buds of our graces, and nip them.</p>

<pb n="815" facs="tcp:23461:424"/>company, as to live voluntarily where vexations ſhall daily ſalute me.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, a man is not rightly ſaid to live, untill he hath abandoned wicked ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. <hi>Similis</hi> having lived ſeven yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the world, after a long time ſpent in a military life, he left this Epitaph behind him, <hi>Here lies old</hi> Similis, <hi>yet one that lived but ſeaven yeares.</hi> This made <hi>Frederick</hi> the third, Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> when ſome ſuch friends of his deſired his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to anſwer, <hi>I have lived enough to you; let mee now live to my ſelfe, and with my Lord Christ.</hi> Yea, Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> tenne dayes before he dyed, deſired none might come to him, that ſo, in that time, hee might the better fit himſelf for God. And indeed, that ſoule can never enjoy God, that is not ſometimes retired.</p>
                     <p>O that wee could, in any reaſonable time; give a ſtop to our madding and ſtraying fancies: that we could, after ſo long time ſpent in the luſts of the fleſh, and pride of life, bring home our cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intentions unto our ſelves, ſhake off theſe violent hold-faſts, bid our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions farewel, which have too long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged our ſoules, and eſtranged us from our ſelves.</p>
                     <pb n="816" facs="tcp:23461:425"/>
                     <p>But when we are ſo wedded, combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and glewed to the world, it is no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter to make a ſafe retreat: it is a fleaing to ſome to bee ſundred; thereby you pull away ſome peece of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe, what we cannot doe all at once, let us gaine upon our ſelves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; go back ſtep by ſtep; firſt, block up one paſſage, then another. Will you know what courſe <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> tooke in this caſe? He, to the end that his acquaintance and neareſt friends might not (by cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him abroad, according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome) withdraw him from his ſtudy and bookes, cauſed the haire of his head to be ſhaved off; and after took an order, that they ſhould not peepe out, untill hee had ſhook off his conſorts, by continually making them looſe their labours. It were happy for our young ſtudients, if they would a little imitate him; if they were not overmuch affected and addicted to company keeping; if they would but conſider, that friends are the thieves of time, the moſt precious jewell they can part withall.</p>

                     <p>The men of the world practiſe, what once a Jeſter ſpake, who, when a great Lord asked him, whether he would goe to Heaven or Hell? anſwered, <hi>to hell, for there</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I ſhall bee ſure to meet your Lordſhip, and the greateſt part of mine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</hi> But it is not ſo with the true Chriſtian: he little loves <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that will not follow him without company: and his zeale is cold to heaven, whom the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of numbers can turn another way.

                     <p>But the world wrongs religion, when they accuſe it to bee an enemy to good-fellowſhip: for ſhe hath not a follower, which doth not ſay with <hi>David, Pſa,</hi> 119.63. <hi>I am a companion to all them that feare thee, and keep thy precepts:</hi> for the godly mans chiefe <hi>delight is in the Saints, and ſuch as excell in vertue, Pſalme</hi> 16.3. Yea,
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:23461:426"/>and their fellowſhip is ſo good, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and delectable, that as <hi>Syneſius</hi> was of opinion, that King <hi>Hieron</hi> got more by <hi>Simonides</hi> acquaintance, then <hi>Simonides</hi> did by his; and as we read that <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> were more pleaſured by <hi>Ioſeph, David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> then <hi>Daniel, David,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> were by them: ſo I perſwade my ſelfe, great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would finde themſelves more then requited, if they would vouchſafe the company of ſome poore Saints: for a wiſe and holy Chriſtian (like his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) whereſoever he goes, makes better cheare then he findes, in an happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſpiritual repaſt for bodily. Yea, as <hi>Plato</hi> accounted it one of the foure great privelidges, for which he was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bound to nature, <hi>that he lived in the time of</hi> Socrates: ſo they ſhould thinke it none of the leaſt favours, for which they were bound to bleſſe God, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſo religious and holy ſociety.</p>

As whom would it not ſtirre, to heare oaths ſtrive for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with words; ſcoffs, with oathes; vaine ſpeeches, with both? we love neither to bite, nor fawne; yet we can not forbeare to ſpeak the naked truth; which if we do, will breed a quarrel. As for inſtance; one, jeſts pleaſantly with his Maker; another, makes himſelfe ſport with Scripture; a third, fils his mouth with oathes of ſound; a fourth, ſcoffs at the religious; one, ſpeaks villany; another, laughs at it; a third, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it; one, makes himſelfe a ſwine, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, a divell.

<pb n="825" facs="tcp:23461:429"/>therefore he is puniſhed with hearing of their deſtruction, that was too remiſſe in hearing of their tranſgreſſion. It is eaſie to be guilty of anothers wickedneſſe, even our very permiſſion appropriates crimes to us: we need no more guiltineſſe of any ſinne, then our willing tolleration. All ſinnes which we give allowance to, being committed, or not hindered by us, if we may, are ours, as if we committed them: firſt, Commanders; 2. Abbettors; 3. Counſellors; 4. Conſenters; 5.

What ſaith the Prophet to King <hi>Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, wouldeſt thou helpe the wicked,</hi> and not only ſo, but <hi>wouldest thou love them that hate the Lord? therefore for this thing the wrath of the Lord is upon thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2. we need doe no more to bring the wrath of God upon us, then even to love and favour thoſe which hate him.</p>
                     <p>How much better then to oppoſe thy friend by reproving him, then that God ſhould reprove thee for being at one with him.</p>

And Philoſophy tell us, <hi>that is truly perfect love, which, to profit and doe good, feareth not to hurt or offend; that admonitions and corrections are the cheifeſt offices of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

                     <p>A wiſe man will ſay to his friend, love heartily, and then ſpeake what thou wilt.

                     <p>And what if <hi>admonition</hi> and <hi>reproofe</hi> be as <hi>unwelcome</hi> to thy friend, as water into a Ship? what if it ſound no better to him, then muſick out of tune; or taſt no ſweeter, then bitter pills, which ſicke men take with an unwilling willingneſſe? wilt thou neglect the office of a friend, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſuſpition of an enemy?</p>

                     <p>Againe, as in Gods and their owne behalfe we are bound to reprove them: ſo in our neighbours alſo, to whom, in this caſe, we owe a duty: for, admit we are in company when, and where our brothers good name is taken away by falſe report; it is our duty to defend the truth, in his behalfe: we muſt neither backbite others, nor be willing to give eare unto backbiters of others.

                     <p>But thou wilt aske me. What need men <hi>trouble themſelves</hi> with that which ſo <hi>little concernes</hi> them?</p>
                     <p>My anſwere ſhall be ſuch another queſtion. What needed <hi>Moſes</hi> to have afflicted himſelfe with the afflictions of others, that he might worke their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when himſelfe was at eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                     <p>But ſuppoſe we offend them not this way; yet we ſhall another, if we keepe them company. The naturall man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of himſelfe, farre beyond what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="831" facs="tcp:23461:432"/>doe that which you never dreamt of: like <hi>Herod,</hi> who cut off <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt's head, only to anſwer the expectation of the ſtanders by, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.9. As for flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it never wants welcome, while ſelfe-love is at home: but the plaine dealing man cannot live among theſe Vipers, and not be ſtung by them: yea, he lives moſt in trouble, that moſt ſeekes to have peace with them by a familiarity.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if they are ſo offenſive to the ſtomacke of our company, that they will not let us be at peace; our beſt way wil be to ſpevv them out, to deale with our old vicious conſorts, as the Fox in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble did by his Fleas: who wading back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the water, by degrees, drew them all into a lock of Wooll, which he had in his mouth, and then left it ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; even leave them, without taking leave of them; or if you like not to teare friendſhip aſunder upon the ſudden, you may unſowe it by little and little. He that would not continue a friend, may but neglect him, and have his ayme.</p>

                     <p>Yea, a man may ſay of ſuch friends, as a learned Antiquary ſaid of <hi>Rumney</hi> Marſh, <hi>bad in Winter, hurtfull in Summer, never good:</hi> nay, this compariſon falls ſhort, for thou haſt ſped well, if ſuch friends prove not dangerouſly hurtfull, as well as helpeleſſe.

                     <p>But ſee the depth of ſuch a mans love, and whether it be not to damn thy body and ſoule everlaſtingly.

                     <p>Indeed there is a kind of <hi>agreement,</hi> which is ſtrengthened by ſinne it ſelfe: as if one fee the keeper of a wench, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy is bought for ever. But all this while, if one call another, friend, it is but to give him a nick-name, whereof hee is not guilty: for true friendſhip is ſo ſacred, holy, and pure, that it will not be uſed in evill: which made <hi>Pericles,</hi> when hee was deſired by a friend of his, to aide him with falſe witneſſe, anſwere, <hi>that hee would befriend him as farre as the Altar,</hi> meaning ſo farre, as ſtood with piety and religion, or his duty to God, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and <hi>Phecion</hi> refuſe to help his ſon in law <hi>Cariles</hi> in judgement, being accuſed for bribery, ſaying withall, <hi>that hee had made him his friend and allie in juſt and reaſonable matters, and in them only;</hi> and this likewiſe made <hi>Papinian,</hi> a Pagan, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded by the Emperor <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calla,</hi> whoſe Steward and familiar he was) refuſe to defend an unjuſt cauſe, (as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi>

                     <p>Thoſe that are truly gracious, know how to receive the bleſſings of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contempt of them who want; and have learned to be thankful, without over lines; knowing themſelves have beene, or may be, as wretched and undeſerving, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks. A true Chriſtian can diſtinguiſh betweene perſons and vices; offenders, and offences: and have no peace with the one, while hee hath true peace with the other; love them, as men; hate them, as evil men; love, what they are, not what they doe; as God made them, not as they have made themſelves; not ſo hate, as to be a foe to goodneſſe; nor ſo love, as to foſter iniquity. It is a queſtion, whether is worſt of the two, to be vices friend, or vertues enemy.

                        <hi>hate</hi> the vices of a wicked man, and <hi>love</hi> his perſon; as the Phyſitian, hateth the diſeaſe, but loveth the perſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed; there is nothing more praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as ſaith the ſame Father.
